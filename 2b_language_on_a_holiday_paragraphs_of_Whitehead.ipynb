       " \"  EDITORS' PREFACE\",\n",
       " \" Process and Reality, Whitehead's magnum opus, is one of the major philosophical works of the modern world, and an extensive body of secondary literature has developed around it. Yet surely no significant philosophical book has appeared in the last two centuries in nearly so deplorable a condition as has this one, with its many hundreds of errors and with over three hundred discrepancies between the American (Macmillan) and the English (Cambridge) editions, which appeared in different formats with divergent paginations. The work itself is highly technical and far from easy to understand, and in many passages the errors in those editions were such as to compound the difficulties. The need for a corrected edition has been keenly felt for many decades.\",\n",
       " ' The principles to be used in deciding what sorts of corrections ought to be introduced into a new edition of Process and Reality are not, however, immediately obvious. Settling upon these principles requires that one take into account the attitude toward book production exhibited by Whitehead, the probable history of the production of this volume, and the two original editions of the text as they compare with each other and with other books by Whitehead. We will discuss these various factors to provide background in terms of which the reader can understand the rationale for the editorial decisions we have made.',\n",
       " ' Whitehead did not spend much of his own time on the routine tasks associated with book production. Professor Raphael Demos was a young colleague of Whitehead on the Harvard faculty at the time, 1925, of the publication of Science and the Modern World. Demos worked over the manuscript editorially, read the proofs, and did the Index for that volume. The final sentence of Whitehead\\'s Preface reads: \"My most grateful thanks are due to my colleague Mr. Raphael Demos for reading the proofs and for the suggestion of many improvements in expression.\" After retiring from Harvard in the early 1960\\'s, Demos became for four years a colleague at Vanderbilt University of Professor Sherburne and shared with him his personal observations concerning Whitehead\\'s indifference to the production process.',\n",
       " \" Bertrand Russell x provides further evidence of Whitehead's sense of priorities when he reports that Whitehead, in response to Russell's com-\",\n",
       " ' 1 Portraits from Memory (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1956), p. 104.',\n",
       " \"  vi Editors' Preface\",\n",
       " ' plaint that he had not answered a letter, \"justified himself by saying that if he answered letters, he would have no time for original work/\\' Russell found this justification \"complete and unanswerable/\\'',\n",
       " ' In 1929, when Process and Reality was in production, the same sense of priorities was operative. Whitehead was sixty-eight years old, and he still had major projects maturing in his mind: Adventures of Ideas, Modes of Thought, and numerous articles and lectures were still to come. \"Original work,\" fortunately, continued to take precedence in his life over humdrum details and trivia. Unfortunately, however, 1929 found Demos in England (working with Russell). As best we can determine at this time, no one with both a familiarity with Whitehead\\'s thought and an eye for detail undertook to shepherd Process and Reality through the production process —Demos, in particular, was never aware that anyone else from the philosophical community had worked on the manuscript or proofs. Whitehead\\'s only personal acknowledgment in the Preface is to \"the constant encouragement and counsel which I owe to my wife.\"',\n",
       " ' An examination of the available evidence, including the discrepancies between the two original editions and the types of errors they contained, has led us to the following reconstruction of the production process and of the origin of some of the types of errors.',\n",
       " \" First, to some extent in conjunction with the preparation of his Gifford Lectures and to some extent as an expansion and revision of them, 2 Whitehead prepared a hand-written manuscript. Many of the errors in the final product, such as incorrect references, misquoted poetry, other faulty quotations, faulty and inconsistent punctuation, and some of the wrong and missing words, surely originated at this stage and were due to Whitehead's lack of attention to details. In addition, the inconsistencies in formal matters were undoubtedly due in part to the fact that the manuscript was quite lengthy and was written over a period of at least a year and a half.\",\n",
       " ' Second, a typist (possibly at Macmillan) prepared a typed copy for the printer. The errors that crept into the manuscript at this stage seem to include, besides the usual sorts of typographical errors, misreadings of Whitehead\\'s somewhat difficult hand. 3 For example, the flourish initiating Whitehead\\'s capital \"H\" was sometimes transcribed as a \"T,\" so that \"His\" came out \"This,\" and \"Here\" came out \"There.\" Also, not only the regular mistranscription of \"Monadology\" as \"MonodoZogy,\" but also other mistranscriptions, such as \"transmuted\" for \"transmitted\" and \"goal\" for \"goad,\" probably occurred at this stage. (Professor Victor Lowe',\n",
       " ' 2 See Victor Lowe, \"Whitehead\\'s Gifford Lectures/\\' The Southern journal of Philosophy, Vol. 1, No. 4 (Winter, 1969-70), 329-38.',\n",
       " ' 3 For samples of his handwriting, see the letters published in Alfred North Whitehead: Essays on His Philosophy, ed. George L. Kline (New York: Prentice-Hall, 1963), p. 197; and The Philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead, ed. Paul Arthur Schilpp, 2nd ed. (New York: Tudor Publishing, 1951), pp. 66465.',\n",
       " \"  Editors' Preface vii\",\n",
       " ' has reported an incident which, whether or not it involved a misreading of Whitehead\\'s handwriting, provided— as Lowe says— a bad omen for what would happen to the book: \"On April 11, 1928, Kemp Smith received this cable from Whitehead: title gifford lectures is process and reality',\n",
       " ' SYLLOBUS FOLLOWING SHORTLY BY MAIL WHITCHCAD.\" 4 )',\n",
       " \" Third, it appears that Macmillan set type first and that Cambridge set its edition a bit later, using either a copy of the typed manuscript or, more likely, a copy of Macmillan's proof sheets. There are a large number of errors which the two editions had in common, a large number in the Macmillan edition which were not in the Cambridge edition, and some few in the latter which were not in the former. Their distribution and their character suggest the following observations : Macmillan provided poor proofreading; the Cambridge editor did a much more rigorous job of catching typographical errors; the Cambridge editor also initiated certain sorts of editorial changes, which primarily involved punctuation, though these were not consistently applied throughout the entire text; finally, the types of errors unique to the Cambridge edition seem not to be due to carelessness, but to deliberate attempts to make the text more intelligible— attempts which fell short of their goal because the Cambridge editor did not understand Whitehead's technical concepts.\",\n",
       " ' There is independent evidence that Whitehead himself saw proofs. Lowe has published a letter from Whitehead to his son, dated August 12, 1929, which reads in part: \"At last I have got through with my Gifford Lectures — final proofs corrected, Index Printed, and the last corrections put in/\\' 5 The deplorable state of the text, plus Whitehead\\'s lack of enthusiasm for this sort of work, make it virtually certain that he did not do much careful proofreading, Lowe reports 6 that Whitehead, after discussions with C. I. Lewis, decided to change the adjectival form of \"category\" from \"categorical\" to \"categoreal\" and made this change throughout the galleys. We strongly suspect that Whitehead\\'s work on the proofs was limited for the most part to very particular, specific corrections of this sort.',\n",
       " ' It would have been useful in the preparation of this corrected edition to have had Whitehead\\'s manuscript and/or typescript. Unfortunately, all efforts to locate them have been unsuccessful— both are probably no longer extant. We do have some corrections, additions, and marginalia which Whitehead himself added to his Cambridge and Macmillan copies. In addition there is a one-page list entitled \"Misprints\" (evidently given to Whitehead by someone else) with an endorsement in Whitehead\\'s handwriting: \"Corrections all inserted.\" This data was given to us by Lowe, who is writing the authorized biography of Whitehead and has been given access to family materials, and to whom we express our deep appreciation.',\n",
       " ' 4 Lowe, op. cii. y 334, fn. 14.',\n",
       " ' *Ibid., 338.',\n",
       " ' Q Ibid., fn. 19; as Lowe reports, he received this information from H. N. Lee.',\n",
       " \"  viii Editors' Preface\",\n",
       " ' Finally, in 1966 Lowe was allowed by Mrs. Henry Copley Greene to see a typescript of Part V, which was inscribed: \"Rosalind Greene with his love From Alfred Whitehead Oct. 12, 1928.\" This typescript had some corrections in Whitehead\\'s hand on it; Lowe reports that, with one exception, the published texts contained these corrections (e.g., the capitalization of \\'Creature\\' and \\'Itself\\' in the last paragraph).',\n",
       " ' It was on the basis of the above evidence and interpretations that we arrived at the principles that guided our editorial work in regard to both the more trivial and the more significant issues.',\n",
       " ' The most difficult and debatable editorial decisions had to be made, ironically, concerning relatively trivial matters, especially those involving punctuation. We tried to steer a middle course between two unacceptable extremes.',\n",
       " ' On the one hand, the editors of a \"corrected edition\" might have introduced into the text all the changes which they would have suggested to a still-living author. The obvious problem with this alternative is that, since the author is no longer living, he would have no chance to veto these \"improvements\" as being inconsistent with his own meaning or stylistic preferences.',\n",
       " \" On the other hand, to avoid this problem the editors might have decided to remove only the most obvious and egregious errors, otherwise leaving the text as it was. One problem with this alternative is that this important work would again be published without benefit of the kind of careful editorial work Whitehead had every right to expect— work which the Cambridge editor began but did not carry out consistently. Another problem is that there are over three hundred divergencies between the two original editions. In these places it is impossible simply to leave the text as it was— a choice must be made. And clearly, in most of these places the Cambridge punctuation is preferable and must be followed— it would be totally irresponsible to revert to Macmillan's punctuation. But once Cambridge's punctuation has been followed in these places, the question arises, How could one justify accepting Cambridge's improvements in these instances and yet not make similar improvements in parallel passages?\",\n",
       " \" Accordingly, in trying to steer a middle course between these two extremes we decided that the most responsible plan of action would be to take the changes introduced bv the Cambridge editor (which, of course, were made during Whitehead's life-time and could have been vetoed in his personal copies) as precedents for the kinds of changes to be carried out consistently. A prime example is provided by the fact that Cambridge deleted many, but not all, of the commas which often appeared between the subject and the verb in Macmillan. However, we left some other questionable practices (e.g., the frequent use of a semicolon where grammatical rules would call for a comma) as they were, primarily because Cambridge did not provide sufficient precedents for changes, even though we would\",\n",
       " \"  Editors' Preface ix\",\n",
       " ' ourselves have suggested changes to Whitehead had we been editing this book in 1929,',\n",
       " ' Working within these guidelines, the editors have sought to produce a text that is free not only of the hundreds of blatant errors found in the original, especially in the Macmillan edition, but also free of many of the minor sorts of inconsistencies recognized and addressed to some extent by the Cambridge editor.',\n",
       " \" It is in the matter of the more significant corrections involving word changes that editors must guard against the possibility that interpretative bias might lead to textual distortions. There were three factors which helped us guard against this possibility. First, we drew heavily upon a substantial amount of previous work, coordinated by Sherburne, in which the suggested corrigenda lists of six scholars were collated and then circulated among eight scholars for opinions and observations. The publication of the results of these discussions, 7 plus the lengthy discussions that preceded and followed it, have established a consensus view about many items which provided guidance. Second, in their own work the two editors approach Whitehead's thought from different perspectives and focus their work around different sorts of interests. Third, we used the principle that no changes would be introduced into the text unless they were endorsed by both editors.\",\n",
       " ' We note, finally, that there can be no purely mechanical guidelines to guarantee objectivity and prevent distortion. Ultimately, editors must rely upon their own judgment, their knowledge of their texts, and their common sense. Recognizing this, we accept full responsibility for the decisions we have made.',\n",
       " ' Besides the issues discussed above, there were other editorial decisions to be made. There were substantial differences of format between the two original editions. Cambridge had a detailed Table of Contents at the beginning of the book, whereas Macmillan had only a brief listing of major divisions at the beginning with the detailed materials spread throughout the book as \"Abstracts\" prior to each of the five major Parts of the volume. Primarily because it is a nuisance to locate the various sections of this analytic Table of Contents in Macmillan, we have followed Cambridge in this matter. We have also followed the Cambridge edition in setting off some quotations and have let it guide us in regard to the question as to which quotations to set off (the Macmillan edition did not even set off page-length items).',\n",
       " ' Since most of the secondary literature on Process and Reality gives page references to the Macmillan edition, we considered very seriously the possibility of retaining its pagination in this new edition. For several technical',\n",

       " ' In regard to certain minor differences between the texts, some of which reflect American vs. British conventions, we have followed Macmillan. Examples are putting periods and commas inside the quotation marks, numbering the footnotes consecutively within each chapter rather than on each page, and writing \"Section\" instead of using the symbol \"$.\"',\n",
       " \" Except for those matters, which simply reflect different conventions, we have left a record of all of the changes which we have made. That is, in the Editors' Notes at the back of the book we have indicated all the divergencies (or, in a few cases, types of divergencies) from both original editions, no matter how trivial, thereby giving interested scholars access to both previous readings through this corrected edition. We have indicated in the text, by means of single and double obelisks ( f and i ) , the places where these divergencies occur. The more exact meaning of these symbols, plus that of the single and double asterisks, is explained in the introductory statement to the Editors' Notes.\",\n",
       " ' The original editions had woefully inadequate Indexes. For this volume, Griffin has prepared a totally new, enormously expanded Index. Sincere thanks are due to Professor Marjorie Suchocki, who correlated the Index items to the pagination in this new edition, and to Professor Bernard M. Loomer, who many years ago prepared an expanded Index which was made available to other scholars.',\n",
       " ' One other edition of Process and Reality has appeared which has not yet been mentioned. In 1969, The Free Press published a paperback edition. It should in no way be confused with the present corrected edition, published by the same company. The 1969 edition did not incorporate the corrigenda which had been published by Sherburne; it added some newerrors of its own; it introduced yet another pagination without indicating the previous standard pagination; and it did not contain a new Index. We wish to commend The Free Press for now publishing this corrected edition.',\n",

The philosophic scheme which they endeavour to explain is termed the 'Philosophy of Organism/ There is no doctrine put forward which cannot cite in its defence some explicit statement of one of this group of thinkers, or of one of the two founders of all Western thought, Plato and Aristotle. But the philosophy of organism is apt to emphasize just those elements in the writings of these masters which subsequent systematizers have put aside. The writer who most fully anticipated the main positions of the philosophy of organism is John Locke in his Essay, especially x in its later books.\",\n",

Any one of these writers is one-sided in his presentation of the groundwork of experience; but as a whole they give a general presentation which dominates the development of subsequent philosophy. I started the investigation with the expectation of being occupied with the exposition of the divergencies from every member of this group.

       " ' In the second part, the discussions of modern thought have been confined to the most general notions of physics and biology, with a careful avoidance of all detail. Also, it must be one of the motives of a complete cosmology to construct a system of ideas which brings t the aesthetic, moral, and religious interests into relation with those concepts of the world which have their origin in natural science.',\n",
       " \" In the third and fourth parts, the cosmological scheme is developed in terms of its own categoreal notions, and without much regard to other systems of thought. For example, in Part II there is a chapter on the 'Extensive Continuum/ which is largely concerned with the notions of Descartes and Newton, compared with the way in which the organic philosophy must interpret this feature of the world. But in Part IV, this question is treated from the point of view of developing the detailed method [viz] in which the philosophy of organism establishes the theory of this problem. It must be thoroughly understood that the theme of these lectures is not a detached consideration of various traditional philosophical problems which acquire urgency in certain traditional systems of thought. The lectures are intended to state a condensed scheme of cosmological ideas, to develop their meaning by confrontation with the various topics of experience, and finally to elaborate an adequate cosmology in terms of which all particular topics find theirt interconnections. Thus the unity of treatment is to be looked for in the gradual development of the scheme, in meaning and in relevance, and not in the successive treatment of particular topics. For example, the doctrines of time, of space, of perception, and of causality are recurred to again and again, as the cosmology develops. In each recurrence, these topics throw some new light on the scheme, or receive some new elucidation. At the end, in so far as the enterprise has been successful, there should be no problem of space-time, or of epistemology, or of causality, left over for discussion. The scheme should have developed all those generic notions adequate for the expression of any possible interconnection of things.\",\n",
       " ' Among the contemporary schools of thought, my obligations to the English and American Realists are obvious. In this connection, I should like especially to mention Professor T. P. Nunn, of the University of London. His anticipations, in the Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, of some of the doctrines of recent Realism, do not appear to be sufficiently well known.',\n",
       " ' I am also greatly indebted to Bergson, William James, and John Dewey. One of my preoccupations has been to rescue their type of thought from the charge of anti-intellectualism, which rightly or wrongly has been associated with it. Finally, though throughout the main body of the work I',\n",

       " \" am in sharp disagreement with Bradley, the final outcome is after all not so greatly different. I am particularly indebted to his chapter on the nature [viii] of experience, which appears in his Essays on Truth and Reality. His insistence on 'feeling' is very consonant with my own conclusions. This whole metaphysical position is an implicit repudiation of the doctrine of Vacuous actuality/\",\n",
       " ' The fifth part is concerned with the final interpretation of the ultimate way in which the cosmological problem is to be conceived. It answers the question, What does it all come to? In this part, the approximation to Bradley is evident. Indeed, if this cosmology be deemed successful, it becomes natural at this point to ask whether the type of thought involved be not a transformation of some main doctrines of Absolute Idealism onto a realistic basis.',\n",
       " ' These lectures will be best understood by noting the following list of prevalent habits of thought, which are repudiated, in so far as concerns their influence on philosophy:',\n",
       " ' (i) The distrust of speculative philosophy.',\n",
       " ' (ii) The trust in language as an adequate expression of propositions.',\n",

       " ' (viii) Arbitrary deductions in ex absurdo arguments.',\n",
       " ' (ix) Belief that logical inconsistencies can indicate anything else than some antecedent errors.',\n",
       " ' By reason of its ready acceptance of some, or all. of these nine myths and fallacious procedures, much nineteenth-century philosophy excludes itself from relevance to the ordinary stubborn facts of daily life.',\n",
       " ' The positive doctrine of these lectures is concerned with the becoming, the being, and the relatedness of \\'actual entities/ An \"actual entity\\' is a res vera in the [ix] Cartesian sense of that term; 2 it is a Cartesian \\'substance/ and not an Aristotelian \\'primary substance/ But Descartes retained in his metaphysical doctrine the Aristotelian dominance of the category of \\'quality\\' over that of \\'relatedness/ In these lectures \\'relatedness\\' is dominant over \\'quality/ All relatedness has its foundation in the relatedness of actualities; and such relatedness is wholly concerned with the appropriation of the dead by the living— that is to say, with \\'objective immortality\\' whereby what is divested of its own living immediacy becomes',\n",
       " \" 2 1 derive my comprehension of this element in Descartes' thought from Professor Gilson of the Sorbonne. I believe that he is the first to insist on its importance. He is, of course, not responsible for the use made of the notion in these lectures.\",\n",

       " \" The history of philosophy discloses two cosmologies which at different periods have dominated European thought, Plato's Timaeus, 3 and the cosmology of the seventeenth century, whose chief authors were Galileo, Descartes, Newton, Locke. In attempting an enterprise of the same kind, it is wise to follow the clue that perhaps the true solution consists in a fusion of the two previous schemes, with modifications demanded by selfconsistency and the advance of knowledge. The cosmology explained in these lectures has been framed in accordance with this reliance on the positive value of the philosophical tradition. One test of success is adequacy in the comprehension of the variety of experience within the limits of one scheme of ideas. The endeavour to satisfy this condition is illustrated by comparing Chapters III, VII, and X of Part II, respectively entitled The Order of Nature/ The Subjectivist Principle/ and Trocess/ with Chapter [x] V of Part III, entitled The Higher Phases of Experience/ and with Chapter V of Part IV, entitled 'Measurement/ and with Chapter II of Part V. entitled 'God and thet World/ These chapters should be recognizable as the legitimate outcome of the one scheme of ideas stated in the second chapter of Part I.\",\n",
       " ' In these lectures I have endeavoured to compress the material derived from years of meditation. In putting out these results, four strong impressions dominate my mind: First, that the movement of historical, and philosophical, criticism of detached questions, which on the whole has dominated the last two centuries, has done its work, and requires to be supplemented by a more sustained effort of constructive thought. Secondly, that the true method of philosophical construction is to frame a scheme of ideas, the best that one can, and unflinchingly to explore the interpretation of experience in terms of that scheme. Thirdly, that all constructive thought, on the various special topics of scientific interest, is dominated by some such scheme, unacknowledged, but no less influential in guiding the imagination. The importance of philosophy lies in its sustained effort to make such schemes explicit, and thereby capable of criticism and improvement.',\n",
       " ' There remains the final reflection, how shallow, puny, and imperfect are efforts to sound the depths in the nature of things. In philosophical discussion, the merest hint of dogmatic certainty as to finality of statement is an exhibition of folly.',\n",

       " ' SECTION I',\n",
       " \" [4] This course of lectures is designed as an essay in Speculative Philosophy. Its first task must be to define 'speculative philosophy/ and to defend it as a method productive of important knowledge.\",\n",
       " \" Speculative Philosophy is the endeavour to frame a coherent, logical, necessary system of general ideas in terms of which every element of our experience can be interpreted. By this notion of 'interpretation' I mean that everything of which we are conscious, as enjoyed, perceived, willed, or thought, shall have the character of a particular instance of the general scheme. Thus the philosophical scheme should be coherent, logical, and, in respect to its interpretation, applicable and adequate. Here 'applicable' means that some items of experience are thus interpretable, and 'adequate' means that there are no items incapable of such interpretation.\",\n",
       " \" [5] 'Coherence,' as here employed, means that the fundamental ideas, in terms of which the scheme is developed, presuppose each other so that in isolation they are meaningless. This requirement does not mean that they are definable in terms of each other; it means that what is indefinable in one such notion cannot be abstracted from its relevance to the other notions. It is the ideal of speculative philosophy that its fundamental notions shall not seem capable of abstraction from each other. In other words, it is presupposed that no entity can be conceived in complete abstraction from the system of the universe, and that it is the business of speculative philosophy to exhibit this truth. This character is its coherence.\",\n",
       " \" The term 'logical' has its ordinary meaning, including 'logical' consistency, or lack of contradiction, the definition of constructs in logical terms, the exemplification of general logical notions in specific instances, and the principles of inference. It will be observed that logical notions must themselves find their places in the scheme of philosophic notions.\",\n",
       " \" It will also be noticed that this ideal of speculative philosophy has its rational side and its empirical side. The rational side is expressed by the terms 'coherent' and 'logical/ The empirical side is expressed by the terms 'applicable' and 'adequate.' But the two sides are bound together by clearing away an ambiguity which remains in the previous explanation of the term 'adequate.' The adequacy of the scheme over every item does not mean adequacy over such items as happen to have been considered. It\",\n",
       " '  4 The Speculative Scheme',\n",
       " \" means that the texture of observed experience, as illustrating the philosophic scheme, is such that all related experience must exhibit the same texture. Thus the philosophic scheme should be 'necessary/ in the sense of bearing in itself its own warrant of universality throughout all experience, provided that we confine ourselves to that which communicates with immediate matter of fact. But what does not so communicate is [6] unknowable, and the unknowable is unknown; x and so this universality defined by 'communication' can suffice.\",\n",
       " ' This doctrine of necessity in universality means that there is an essence to the universe which forbids relationships beyond itself, as a violation of its rationality. Speculative philosophy seeks that essence.',\n",
       " ' SECTION II',\n",
       " ' Philosophers can never hope finally to formulate these metaphysical first principles. Weakness of insight and deficiencies of language stand in the way inexorably. Words and phrases must be stretched towards a generality foreign to their ordinary usage; and however such elements of language be stabilized as technicalities, they remain metaphors mutely appealing for an imaginative leap.',\n",
       " ' There is no first principle which is in itself unknowable, not to be captured by a flash of insight. But, putting aside the difficulties of language, deficiency in imaginative penetration forbids progress in any form other that that of an asymptotic approach to a scheme of principles, only definable in terms of the ideal which they should satisfy.',\n",
       " ' The difficulty has its seat in the empirical side of philosophy. Our datum is the actual world, including ourselves; and this actual world spreads itself for observation in the guise of the topic of our immediate experience. The elucidation of immediate experience is the sole justification for any thought; and the starting-point* for thought is the analytic observation of components of this experience. But we are not conscious of any clear-cut complete analysis of immediate experience, in terms of the various details which comprise its definiteness. We habitually observe by the method of -~ difference. Sometimes we see an elephant, and sometimes we do not. The result is that an elephant, when present, is noticed. [7] Facility of observation depends on the fact that the object observed is important when present, and sometimes is absent. ^',\n",
       " ' The metaphysical first principles can never fail of exemplification. We can never catch the actual world taking a holiday from their sway. Thus, for the discovery of metaphysics, the method of pinning down thought to the strict systematization of detailed discrimination, already effected by antecedent observation, breaks down. This collapse of the method of rigid empiricism is not confined to metaphysics. It occurs whenever we seek the',\n",
       " \" 1 This doctrine is a paradox. Indulging in a species of false modesty, 'cautious' philosophers undertake its definition.\",\n",
       " '  Speculative Philosophy 5',\n",
       " ' larger generalities. In natural science this rigid method is the Baconian method of induction, a method which, if consistently pursued, would have left science where it found it. What Bacon omitted was the play of a free imagination, controlled by the requirements of coherence and logic. The true method of discovery is like the flight of an aeroplane. It starts from the ground of particular observation; it makes a flight in the thin air of imaginative generalization; and it again lands for renewed observation rendered acute by rational interpretation. The reason for the success of this method of imaginative rationalization is that, when the method of difference fails, factors which are constantly present may yet be observed under the influence of imaginative thought. Such thought supplies the differences which the direct observation lacks. It can even play with inconsistency; and can thus throw light on the consistent, and persistent, elements in experience by comparison with what in imagination is inconsistent with them. The negative judgment is the peak of mentality. But the conditions for the success of imaginative construction must be rigidly adhered to. In the first place, this construction must have its origin in the generalization of particular factors discerned in particular topics of human interest; for example, in physics, or in physiology, or in psychology, or in aesthetics, or in ethical beliefs, or in sociology, or in languages conceived as storehouses of human experience. In [8] this way the prime requisite, that anyhow there shall be some important application, is secured. The success of the imaginative experiment is always to be tested by the applicability of its results beyond the restricted locus from which it originated. In default of such extended application, a generalization started from physics, for example, remains merely an alternative expression of notions applicable to physics. The partially successful philosophic generalization will, if derived from physics, find applications in fields of experience beyond physics. It will enlighten observation in those remote fields, so that general principles can be discerned as in process of illustration, which in the absence of the imaginative generalization are obscured by their persistent exemplification.',\n",
       " ' Thus the first requisite is to proceed by the method of generalization so that certainly there is some application; and the test of some success is application beyond the immediate origin. In other words, some synoptic vision has been gained.',\n",
       " \" In this description of philosophic method, the term 'philosophic generalization' has meant 'the utilization of specific notions, applying to a restricted group of facts, for the divination of the generic notions which apply to all facts/\",\n",
       " ' In its use of this method natural science has shown a curious mixture of rationalism and irrationalism. Its prevalent tone of thought has been ardently rationalistic within its own borders, and dogmatically irrational beyond those borders. In practice such an attitude tends to become a dogmatic denial that there are any factors in the world not fully expressible',\n",
       " '  6 The Speculative Scheme',\n",
       " ' in terms of its own primary notions devoid of further generalization. Such a denial is the self-denial of thought.',\n",
       " ' The second condition for the success of imaginative construction is unflinching pursuit of the two rationalistic ideals, coherence and logical perfection.',\n",
       " ' Logical perfection does not here require any detailed [9] explanation. An example of its importance is afforded by the role of mathematics in the restricted field of natural science. The history of mathematics exhibits the generalization of special notions observed in particular instances. In any branches of mathematics, the notions presuppose each other. It is a remarkable characteristic of the history of thought that branches of mathematics,! developed under the pure imaginative impulse, thus controlled, finally receive their important application. Time may be wanted. Conic sections had to wait for eighteen hundred years. In more recent years, the theory of probability, the theory of tensors, the theory of matrices are cases in point.',\n",
       " ' The requirement of coherence is the great preservative of rationalistic sanity. But the validity of its criticism is not always admitted. If we consider philosophical controversies, we shall find that disputants tend to require coherence from their adversaries, and to grant dispensations to themselves. It has been remarked that a system of philosophy is never refuted; it is only abandoned. The reason is that logical contradictions, except as temporary slips of the mind— plentiful, though temporary— are the most gratuitous of errors; and usually they are trivial. Thus, after criticism, systems do not exhibit mere illogicalities. They suffer from inadequacy and incoherence. Failure to include some obvious elements of experience in the scope of the system is met by boldly denying the facts. Also while a philosophical system retains any charm of novelty, it enjoys a plenary indulgence for its failures in coherence. But after a system has acquired orthodoxy, and is taught with authority, it receives a sharper criticism. Its denials and its incoherences are found intolerable, and a reaction sets in.',\n",
       " \" Incoherence is the arbitrary disconnection of first principles. In modern philosophy Descartes' two kinds of substance, corporeal and mental, illustrate incoherence. There is, in Descartes 7 philosophy, no reason why there should not be a one-substance world, only corporeal, or [10] a one-substance world, only mental. According to Descartes, a substantial individual 'requires nothing but itself in order to exist/ Thus this system makes a virtue of its incoherence. But,t on the other hand, the facts seem connected, while Descartes' system does not; for example, in the treatment of the bodymind problem. The Cartesian system obviously says something that is true. But its notions are too abstract to penetrate into the nature of things.\",\n",
       " \" t The attraction of Spinoza's philosophy lies in its modification of Descartes' position into greater coherence. He starts with one substance,\",\n",
       " '  Speculative Philosophy 7',\n",
       " \" causa sui, and considers its essential attributes and its individualized modes, i.e., the 'affectiones substantial The gap in the system is the arbitrary introduction of the 'modes/ And yet, a multiplicity of modes is a fixed requisite, if the scheme is to retain any direct relevance to the many occasions in the experienced world.\",\n",
       " \" The philosophy of organism is closely allied to Spinoza's scheme of thought. But it differs by the abandonment of the subject-predicate forms of thought, so far as concerns the presupposition that this form is a direct embodiment of the most ultimate characterization of fact. The result is that the 'substance-quality' concept is avoided; and that morphological description is replaced by description of dynamic process. Also Spinoza's 'modes' now become the sheer actualities; so that, though analysis of them increases our understanding, it does not lead us to the discovery of any higher grade of reality. The coherence, which the system seeks to preserve, is the discovery that the process, or concrescence, of any one actual entity involves the other actual entities among its components. In this way the obvious solidarity of the world receives its explanation.\",\n",
       " ' In all philosophic theory there is an ultimate which is actual in virtue of its accidents. It is only then capable of characterization through its accidental\" embodiments, and apart from these accidents is devoid of [11] actuality. In the philosophy of organism this ultimate is termed \\'creativity\\'; and God is its primordial, non-temporal accident.* In monistic philosophies, Spinoza\\'s or absolute idealism, this ultimate is God, who is also equivalently termed \\'The Absolute.\\' In such monistic schemes, the ultimate is illegitimately allowed a final, \\'eminent\\' reality, beyond that ascribed to any of its accidents. In this general position the philosophy of organism seems to approximate more to some strains of Indian, or Chinese, thought, than to western Asiatic, or European, thought. One side makes process ultimate; the other side makes fact ultimate.',\n",
       " ' SECTION Hit',\n",
       " \" In its turn every philosophy will suffer a deposition. But the bundle of philosophic systems expresses a variety of general truths about the universe, awaiting coordination and assignment of their various spheres of validity. Such progress in coordination is provided by the advance of philosophy; and in this sense philosophy has advanced from Plato onwards. According to this account of the achievement of rationalism, the chief error in philosophy is overstatement. The aim at generalization is sound, but the estimate of success is exaggerated. There are two main forms of such overstatement. One form is what I have termed, f elsewhere, 2 the 'fallacy of misplaced concreteness. 7 This fallacy consists in neglecting the degree of abstraction involved when an actual entity is considered merely\",\n",
       " ' 2 Cf. Science and the Modem World, Ch. III.',\n",
       " '  8 The Speculative Scheme',\n",
       " ' so far as it exemplifies certain categories of thought. There are aspects of actualities which are simply ignored so long as we restrict thought to these categories. Thus the success of a philosophy is to be measured by its comparative avoidance of this fallacy, when thought is restricted within its categories.',\n",
       " ' The other form of overstatement consists in a false estimate of logical procedure in respect to certainty, and in respect to premises. Philosophy has been haunted by the unfortunate notion that its method is dogmatically to indicate premises which are severally clear, distinct, and [12] certain; and to erect upon those premises a deductive system of thought.',\n",
       " ' But the accurate expression of the final generalities is the goal of dis— cussion and not its origin. Philosophy has been misled by the example of mathematics; and even in mathematics the statement of the ultimate logical principles is beset with difficulties, as yet insuperable. 3 The verification of a rationalistic scheme is to be sought in its general success, and not in the peculiar certainty, or initial clarity, of its first principles. In this connection the misuse of the ex absurdo argument has to be noted; much philosophical reasoning is vitiated by it. The only logical conclusion to be drawn, when a contradiction issues from a train of reasoning, is that at least one of the premises involved in the inference is false. It is rashly assumed without further question that the peccant premise can at once be located. In mathematics this assumption is often justified, and philosophers have been thereby misled. But in the absence of a well-defined categoreal scheme of entities, issuing in a satisfactory metaphysical system, every premise in a philosophical argument is under suspicion.',\n",
       " ' Philosophy will not regain its proper status until the gradual elaboration of categoreal schemes, definitely stated at each stage of progress, is recognized as its proper objective. There may be rival schemes, inconsistent among themselves; each with its own merits and its own failures. It will then be the purpose of research to conciliate the differences. Metaphysical categories are not dogmatic statements of the obvious; they are tentative formulations of the ultimate generalities.',\n",
       " \" If we consider any scheme of philosophic categories as one complex assertion, and apply to it the logician's alternative, true or false, the answer must be that the scheme is false. The same answer must be given to a like ques- [13] tion respecting the existing formulated principles of any science.\",\n",
       " ' The scheme is true with unformulated qualifications, exceptions, limitations, and new interpretations in terms of more general notions. We do not yet know how to recast the scheme into a logical truth. But the scheme is a matrix from which true propositions applicable to particular circumstances can be derived. We can at present only trust our trained instincts',\n",
       " ' 3 Cf. Principia Mathematica, by Bertrand Russell and A. N. Whitehead, Vol. I, Introduction and Introduction to the Second Edition. These introductory discussions are practically due to Russell, and in the second edition wholly so.',\n",
       " '  Speculative Philosophy 9',\n",
       " ' as to the discrimination of the circumstances in respect to which the scheme is valid.',\n",
       " ' The use of such a matrix is to argue from it boldly and with rigid logic. The scheme should therefore be stated with the utmost precision and definiteness, to allow of such argumentation. The conclusion of the argument should then be confronted with circumstances to which it should apply.',\n",
       " ' The primary advantage thus gained is that experience is not interrogated with the benumbing repression of common sense. The observation acquires an enhanced penetration by reason of the expectation evoked by the conclusion of the argument. The outcome from this procedure takes one of three forms: (i) the conclusion may agree with the observed facts; (ii) the conclusion may exhibit general agreement, with disagreement in detail; (iii) the conclusion may be in complete disagreement witht the facts.',\n",
       " ' In the first case, the facts are known with more adequacy and the applicability of the system to the world has been elucidated. In the second case, criticisms of the observation of the facts and of the details of the scheme are both required. The history of thought shows that false interpretations of observed facts enter into the records of their observation. Thus both theory, and received notions as to fact, are in doubt. In the third case, a fundamental reorganization of theory is required either by way of limiting it to some special province, or by way of entire abandonment of its main categories of thought.',\n",
       " ' [14] After the initial basis of a rational life, with a civilized language, has been laid, all productive thought has proceeded either by the poetic insight of artists, or by the imaginative elaboration of schemes of thought capable of utilization as logical premises. In some measure or other, progress is always a transcendence of what is obvious.',\n",
       " ' Rationalism never shakes off its status of an experimental adventure. The combined influences of mathematics and religion, which have so greatly contributed to the rise of philosophy, have also had the unfortunate effect of yoking it with static dogmatism. Rationalism is an adventure in the clarification of thought, progressive and never final. But it is an adventure in which even partial success has importance.',\n",

       " \" The field of a special science is confined to one genus of facts, in the sense that no statements are made respecting facts which lie outside that genus. The very circumstance that a science has naturally arisen concerning a set of facts secures that facts of that type have definite relations among themselves which are very obvious to all mankind. The common obviousness of things arises when their explicit apprehension carries immediate importance for purposes of survival, or of enjoyment— that is to say, for purposes of 'being' and of 'well-being/ Elements in human experience,\",\n",

       " ' singled out in this way, are those elements concerning which language is copious and. within its limits, precise. The special sciences, therefore, deal with topics which lie open to easy inspection and are readily expressed by words.',\n",
       " ' The study of philosophy is a voyage towards the larger generalities. For this reason in the infancy of science, when the main stress lay in the discovery of the most general ideas usefully applicable to the subjectmatter in question, philosophy was not sharply distinguished from science. To this day, a new science with any substantial novelty in its notions is considered to be in some way [15] peculiarly philosophical. In their later stages, apart from occasional disturbances, most sciences accept without question the general notions in terms of which they develop. The main stress is laid on the adjustment and the direct verification of more special statements. In such periods scientists repudiate philosophy; Newton, justly satisfied with his physical principles, disclaimed metaphysics.',\n",
       " ' The fate of Newtonian physics warns us that there is a development in scientific first principles, and that their original forms can only be saved by interpretations of meaning and limitations of their field of applicationinterpretations and limitations unsuspected during the first period of successful employment. One chapter in the history of culture is concerned with the growth of generalities. In such a chapter it is seen that the older generalities, like the older hills, are worn down and diminished in height, surpassed by younger rivals.',\n",
       " ' Thus one aim of philosophy is to challenge the half-truths constituting the scientific first principles. The systematization of knowledge cannot be conducted in watertight compartments. All general truths condition each other; and the limits of their application cannot be adequately defined apart from their correlation by yet wider generalities.

This appeal is not solely to the expression of the facts in current verbal statements. The adequacy of such sentences is the main question at issue. It is true that the general agreement of mankind as to experienced facts is best expressed in language.

Apart from this background, the separate entities which go to form the proposition, and the proposition as a whole, are without determinate character. Nothing [17] has been defined, because every definite entity requires a systematic universe to supply its requisite status. Thus every proposition proposing a fact* must, in its complete analysis, propose the general character of the universe required for that fact. There are no self-sustained facts, floating in nonentity. This doctrine, of the impossibility of tearing a proposition from its systematic context in the actual world, is a direct consequence of the fourth and the twentieth of the fundamental categoreal explanations which we shall be engaged in expanding and illustrating. A proposition can embody partial truth because it only demands a certain type of systematic environment, which is presupposed in its meaning. It does not refer to the universe in all its detail.',\n",

For example John Stuart Mill writes: They [the Greeks] t had great difficulty in distinguishing between things which their language confounded, or in putting mentally together things which it distinguished,* and could hardly combine the objects in nature into any classes but those which were made for them by the popular phrases of their own country; or at least could not help fancying those classes to be natural, and all others arbitrary and artificial. Ac- [18] cordingly, scientific investigation among the Greek schools of speculation and their followers in the Middle Ages, was little more than a mere sifting and analysing of the notions attached to common language. They thought that by determining the meaning of words they could become acquainted with facts. 4 Mill then proceeds to quote from Whewell 5 a paragraph illustrating the same weakness of Greek thought.',\n",
       " ' But neither Mill, nor Whewell, tracks this difficulty about language down to its sources. They both presuppose that language does enunciate well-defined propositions. This is quite untrue. Language is thoroughly indeterminate, by reason of the fact that every occurrence presupposes some systematic type of environment.',\n",

It follows that any novelty in metaphysical doctrines exhibits some measure of disagreement with statements of the facts to be found in current philosophical literature. The extent of disagreement measures the extent of metaphysical divergence. It is, therefore, no valid criticism on one metaphysical school to point out that its doctrines do not follow from the verbal expression of the facts accepted by another school.

In particular, there are no precisely stated axiomatic certainties from which to start. There is not even the language in which to frame them. The only possible procedure is to start from verbal expressions which, when taken by themselves with the current meaning of their words, are ill-defined and ambiguous. These are not premises to be immediately reasoned from apart from elucidation by further discussion; they are endeavours to state general principles which will be exemplified in the subsequent description of the facts of experience. This subsequent elaboration should elucidate the meanings to be assigned to the words and phrases employed. Such meanings are incapable of accurate apprehension apart from a correspondingly accurate apprehension of the metaphysical background which the [20] universe provides for them. But no language can be anything but elliptical, requiring a leap of the imagination to understand its meaning in its relevance to immediate experience. The position of metaphysics in the development of culture cannot be understood without remembering that no verbal statement is the adequate expression of a proposition.',\n",

Thus propositions expressed in its language are more easily correlated to our flitting intuitions into metaphysical truth. When we trust these verbal statements and argue as though they adequately analysed meaning, we are led into difficulties which take the shape of negations of what in practice is presupposed. But when they are proposed as first principles they assume an unmerited air of sober obviousness. Their defect is that the true propositions which they do express lose their fundamental character when subjected to adequate expression. For example consider the type of propositions such as The grass is green/ and 'The whale is big/ This subject-predicate form of statement seems so simple, leading straight to a metaphysical first principle; and yet in these examples it conceals such complex, diverse meanings.\",\n",

We no more retain the physics of the seventeenth century than we do the Cartesian philosophy of that century. Yet within limits, both systems express important truths. Also we are beginning to understand the wider categories which define their limits of correct application. Of course, in that century, dogmatic views held sway; so that the validity both of the physical notions, and of the Cartesian notions, was misconceived. Mankind never quite knows what it is after. When we survey the history of thought, and likewise the history of practice, we find that one idea after another is tried out, its limitations defined, and its core of truth elicited. In application to the instinct for the intellectual adventures demanded by particular epochs, there is much truth in Augustine's rhetorical phrase, Securus judicat orbis terrarum. At the very least, men do what they can in the way of systematization, and in the event achieve something. The proper test is not that of finality, but of progress.\",\n",
       " ' But the main objection, dating from the sixteenth century and receiving final expression from Francis Bacon, is the uselessness of philosophic speculation. The position taken by this objection is that we ought to describe detailed matter of fact, and elicit the laws with a generality strictly limited to the systcmatization of these described details. General interpretation, it is held, has no bearing upon this procedure; and thus any system of general interpretation, be it true or false, remains intrinsically barren. Unfortunately for this objection, there are no brute, self-contained matters of fact, capable of being understood apart from interpretation as an element in a system. Whenever we attempt to express the matter of immediate experience, we find that its understanding leads us beyond itself, to its contemporaries, to its past, to its future, and to the universals in terms of which its definiteness is exhibited. But such universals, by their very character of universality, embody the potentiality of other facts with variant types of definiteness. Thus [22] the understanding of the immediate brute fact requires its metaphysical interpretation as an item in a world with some systematic relation to it. When thought comes upon the scene, it finds the interpretations as matters of practice. Philosophy does not initiate interpretations. Its search for a rationalistic scheme is the search for more',\n",

Our habitual experience is a complex of failure and success in the enterprise of interpretation. If we desire a record of uninterpreted experience, we must ask a stone to record its autobiography. Every scientific memoir in its record of the 'facts' is shot through and through with interpretation. The methodology of rational interpretation is the product of the fitful vagueness of consciousness. Elements which shine with immediate distinctness, in some circumstances, retire into penumbral shadow in other circumstances, and into black darkness on other occasions. And yet all occasions proclaim themselves as actualities within the flux of a solid world, demanding a unity of interpretation.\",\n",
       " ' Philosophy is the self-correction by consciousness of its own initial excess of subjectivity. Each actual occasion contributes to the circumstances of its origin additional formative elements deepening its own peculiar individuality. Consciousness is only the last and greatest of such elements by which the selective character of the individual obscures the external totality from which it originates and which it embodies. An actual individual, of such higher grade, has truck with the totality of things by reason of its sheer actuality; but it has attained its individual depth of being by a selective emphasis limited to its own purposes. The task of philosophy is to recover the totality obscured by the selection. It replaces in rational experience what has been submerged in the higher sensitive experience and has been sunk yet deeper by the initial operations of consciousness itself. The selectiveness of individual experience is moral so far as it con[23] forms to the balance of importance disclosed in the rational vision; and conversely the conversion of the intellectual insight into an emotional force corrects the sensitive experience in the direction of morality. The correction is in proportion to the rationality of the insight.',\n",

The antithesis between the general good and the individual interest can be abolished only when the individual is such that its interest is the general good, thus exemplifying the loss of the minor intensities in order to find them again with finer composition in a wider sweep of interest.',\n",
       " ' Philosophy frees itself from the taint of ineffectiveness by its close relations with religion and with science, natural and sociological. It attains its chief importance by fusing the two, namely, religion and science, into one rational scheme of thought. Religion should connect the rational generality of philosophy with the emotions and purposes springing out of existence in a particular society, in a particular epoch, and conditioned by particular antecedents. Religion is the translation of general ideas into particular thoughts, particular emotions, and particular purposes; it is directed to the end of stretching individual interest beyond its self-defeating particularity. Philosophy finds religion, and modifies it; and conversely religion is among the data of experience which philosophy must weave into',\n",

In the higher organisms the differences of tempo between the mere emotions and the conceptual experiences produce a life-tedium, unless this supreme fusion has been effected. The two sides of the organism require a reconciliation in which emotional experiences illustrate a conceptual justification, and conceptual experiences find an emotional illustration.',\n",

In this sense scientific interest is only a variant form of religious interest. Any survey of the scientific devotion to 'truth/ as an ideal, will confirm this statement. There is, however, a grave divergence between science and religion in respect to the phases of individual experience with which they are concerned. Religion is centered upon the harmony of rational thought with the sensitive reaction to the percepta from which experience originates. Science is concerned with the harmony of rational thought with the percepta themselves. When science deals with emotions, the emotions in question are percepta and not immediate passions— other people's emotion and not our own: at least our own in recollection, and not in immediacy. Religion deals with the formation of the experiencing subject; whereas science deals with the objects, which are the data forming the primary phase in this experience. The subject originates from, and amid, given conditions; science conciliates thought with this primary matter of fact; and religion conciliates the thought involved in the process with the sensitive reaction involved in that same process. The process is nothing else than the experiencing subject itself. In this explanation it is presumed that an experiencing subject is one occasion of sensitive reaction to an actual world. Science finds religious experiences among its percepta; and religion finds scientific concepts among the conceptual experiences to be fused with particular sensitive reactions.\",\n",

The whole of the subsequent discussion in these lectures has the purpose of rendering this summary intelligible, and of showing that it embodies generic notions inevitably presupposed in our reflective experience— presupposed, but rarely expressed in explicit distinction. Four notions may be singled out from this summary, by reason of the fact that they involve some divergence from antecedent philosophical thought. These notions are, that of an 'actual entity/ that of a 'prehension,' that of a 'nexus/ and that of the 'ontological principle/ Philosophical thought has made for itself difficulties by dealing exclusively in very abstract notions, such as those of mere awareness, mere private sensation, mere emotion, mere purpose, mere appearance, mere causation. These are the ghosts of the old 'faculties/ banished from psychology, but still haunting metaphysics. There can be no 'mere' togetherness of such abstractions. The result is that philosophical discussion is enmeshed in the fallacy of 'misplaced concreteness.' x In the three notions—actual entity, prehension, nexus— an endeavour has been made to base philosophical thought upon the most concrete elements in our experience.\",\n",
       " \" 'Actual entities'- also termed 'actual occasions'— are the final real things of which the world is made up. There is no going behind actual entities to find anything \\\\28] more real.

But, though there are gradations of importance, and diversities of function, yet in the principles which actuality exemplifies all are on the same level. The final facts are, all alike, actual entities; and these actual entities are drops of experience, coi iplex and interdependent.\",\n",

The ontological principle can be summarized as: no actual entity, then no reason.\",\n",
       " \" Each actual entity is analysable in an indefinite number of ways. In some modes of analysis the component elements are more abstract than in other modes of analysis. The analysis of an actual entity into 'prehensions' is that mode of analysis which exhibits the most concrete elements in the nature of actual entities. This mode of analysis will be termed the 'division' of the actual entity in question. Each actual entity is 'divisible' in an indefinite number of ways, and each way of 'division' yields its definite quota of prehensions. A prehension reproduces in itself the general characteristics of an actual entitv: it is referent to an external world, and in this sense will be said to have a 'vector character'; it involves emotion, and purpose, and valuation, and causation. In fact, any characteristic of an actual entity is reproduced [29] in a prehension. It might have been a complete actuality; but, by reason of a certain incomplete partiality, a prehension is only a subordinate element in an actual entity. A reference to the complete actuality is required to give the reason why such a prehension is what it is in respect to its subjective form. This subjective form is determined by the subjective aim at further integration, so as to obtain the 'satisfaction' of the completed subject. In other words, final causation and atomism are interconnected philosophical principles.\",\n",
       " \" With the purpose of obtaining a one-substance cosmology, 'prehensions' are a generalization from Descartes' mental 'cogitations,' and from Locke's 'ideas,' to express the most concrete mode of analysis applicable to every grade of individual actuality. Descartes and Locke maintained a two-substance ontology— Descartes explicitly, Locke by implication. Descartes, the mathematical physicist, emphasized his account of corporeal substance; and Locke, the physician and the sociologist, confined himself to an account of mental substance. The philosophy of organism, in its scheme for one type of actual entities, adopts the view that Locke's account of mental substance embodies, in a very special form, a more penetrating philosophic description than does Descartes' account of corporeal substance. Nevertheless, Descartes' account must find its place in the philosophic scheme. On the whole, this is the moral to be drawn from the Monadologyt of Leibniz. His monads are best conceived as generalizations of contemporary notions of mentality. The contemporary notions of physical bodies only enter into his philosophv subordinately and derivatively. The philosophy of organism endeavours to hold the balance more evenly. But it does start with a generalization of Locke's account of mental operations.\",\n",

IV). It seems that Bergson's term 'intuition' has the same meaning as 'physical purpose' in Part III of these lectures. Also Bergson's 'intuition' seems to abstract from the subjective form of emotion and purpose. This subjective form is an essential element in the notion of 'conceptual prehension,' as indeed in that of any prehension. It is an essential element in 'physical purpose' (cf. Part III), If we con- [SO] sider these 'pure' mental operations in their most intense operations, we should choose the term 'vision.' A conceptual prehension is a direct vision of some possibility of good or oft evil— of some possibility as to how actualities may be definite. There is no reference to particular actualities, or to any particular actual world. The phrase 'of good or of evil' has been added to include a reference to the subjective form; the mere word 'vision' abstracts from this factor in a conceptual prehension. If we say that God's primordial nature is a completeness of 'appetition,' f we give due weight to the subjective form— at a cost. If we say that God's primordial nature is 'intuition/ we suggest mentality which is 'impure' by reason of synthesis with physical prehension. If we say that God's primordial nature is 'vision,' we suggest a maimed view of the subjective form, divesting it of yearning after concrete fact— no particular facts, but after some actuality.

The notion of an 'enduring object' is, however, capable of more or less completeness of realization. Thus, in different stages of its career, a wave of light may be more or less corpuscular. A train of such waves at all stages of its career involves social order; but in the earlier stages this social order takes the more special form of loosely related strands of personal order. This dominant personal order gradually vanishes as the time advances. Its defining characteristics become less and [54] less important, as their various features peter out.

There are two species of prehensions, the 'positive species' and the 'negative species.' An actual entity has a perfectly definite bond with each item in the universe. This determinate bond is its prehension of that item. A negative prehension is the definite exclusion of that item from positive contribution to the subject's own real internal constitution. This doctrine involves the position that a negative prehension expresses a bond. A positive prehension is the definite inclusion of that item into positive contribution to the subject's own real internal constitution. This positive inclusion is called its 'feeling' of that item. Other entities are required to express how any one item is felt. All actual entities in the actual world, relatively to a given actual entity as 'subject,' are necessarily 'felt' by that subject, though in general vaguely. An actual entity as felt is said to be 'objectified' for that subject. Only a selection of eternal objects are 'felt' by a given subject, and these eternal objects are then said to have 'ingression' in that subject. But those eternal objects which are not felt are not therefore negligible. For each negative prehension has its own subjective form, however trivial and faint. It adds to the emotional complex, though not to the objective data. The emotional complex is the subjective form of the final 'satisfaction.' The importance of negative prehensions arises from the fact, that (i) actual entities form a system, in the sense of entering into each other's constitutions, (ii) that by the ontological principle every entity is felt by some actual entity, (iii) that, as a consequence of (i) and (ii), every entity in the actual world of a concrescent actuality has some gradation of real relevance to that concrescence, (iv) that, in consequence of (iii), the negative prehension of an entity is a\",\n",

Further, in the case of those actualities whose immediate experience is most completely open to us, namely, human beings, the final decision of the immediate subject-superject, constituting the ultimate modification of subjective aim, is the foundation of our experience of responsibility, of approbation or of disapprobation, of self-approval or of self-reproach, of freedom, of emphasis. This element in experience is too large to be put aside merely as misconstruction. It governs the whole tone of human life. It can be illustrated+ by striking [75] instances from fact or from fiction. But these instances are only conspicuous illustrations of human experience during each hour and each minute. The ultimate freedom of things, lying beyond all determinations, was whispered by Galileo— E pur si muove— freedom for the inquisitors to think wrongly, for Galileo to think rightly, and for the world to move in despite of Galileo and inquisitors.\",\n",
       " \" The doctrine of the philosophy of organism is that, however far the sphere of efficient causation be pushed in the determination of components of a concrescence— its data, its emotions, its appreciations, its purposes, its phases of subjective aim— beyond the determination of these components there always remains the final reaction of the self-creative unity of the universe. This final reaction completes the self-creative act by putting the decisive stamp of creative emphasis upon the determinations of efficient cause. Each occasion exhibits its measure of creative emphasis in proportion to its measure of subjective intensity. The absolute standard of such intensity is that of the primordial nature of God, which is neither great nor small because it arises out of no actual world. It has within it no components which are standards of comparison. But in the temporal world for occasions of relatively slight experient intensity, their decisions of creative emphasis are individually negligible compared to the determined components which they receive and transmit. But the final accumulation of all such decisions— the decision of God's nature and the decisions of all occasions—constitutes that special element in the flux of forms in history, which is given 7 and incapable of rationalization beyond the fact that within it every component which is determinable is internally determined.\",\n",

The ontological principle, and the wider doctrine of universal relativity, on which the present metaphysical discussion is founded, blur the sharp distinction between what is universal and what is particular. The notion of a universal is of that which can enter into the description of many particulars; whereas the notion of a particular is that it is described by universal, and does not itself enter into the description of any other particular. According to the doctrine of relativity which is the basis of the metaphysical system of the present lectures, both these notions involve a misconception. An actual entity cannot be described, even inadequately, by universals; because other actual entities do enter into the description of any one actual entity. Thus every so-called 'universal 7 is particular in the sense of being just what it is, diverse from everything else; and every socalled 'particular 7 is universal in the sense of entering into the constitutions of other actual entities. The contrary opinion led to the collapse of Descartes 7 many substances into Spinoza's one substance; to Leibniz's windowless monads with their pre-established harmony; to the sceptical reduction of Hume's philosophy— a reduction first effected by Hume himself, \\\\77] and reissued with the most beautiful exposition by Santayana in his Scepticism and Animal Faith.\",\n",

He arrives at the belief in the actual entity by 'the faculty of judgment. 7 But on this theory he has absolutely no analogy upon which to found any such inference with the faintest shred of probability. Hume, accepting Descartes' account of perception (in this passage), which also belongs to Locke in some sections of his Essay ; easily draws the sceptical conclusion. Santayana irrefutably exposes the full extent to which this scepticism must be carried. The philosophy of organism recurs to Descartes 7 alternative theory of 'realties objectiva,' and endeavours to interpret it in terms of a consistent ontology. Descartes endeavoured to combine the two theories; but his unquestioned acceptance of the subject-predicate dogma forced him [78] into a representative theory of perception, involving a 'judicium 7 validated by our assurance of the power and the goodness of God. The philosophy of organism in its account of prehension takes its stand upon the Cartesian terms 'realitas objectiva, 7 'inspection and Hntuitio. 7 The two latter terms are transformed into the notion of a 'positive prehension, 7 and into operations described in the various categories of physical and conceptual origination. A recurrence to the notion of 'God 7 is still necessary to mediate between physical and conceptual prehensions, but not in the crude form of giving a limited letter of credit to a 'judicium.'\",\n",

For the philosophy of organism, the primary data are always actual entities absorbed into feeling in virtue of certain universals shared alike by the objectified actuality and the experient subject (cf. Part III). Descartes takes an intermediate position. He explains perception in Humian terms, but adds an apprehension of particular actual entities in virtue of an Hnspectio 7 and a 'judicium 7 effected by the mind (Meditations II and IJJ).t Here he is paving the way for Kant, and for the degradation of the world into 'mere appearance.'\",\n",

It was this conservative, other side of Locke which led to his sceptical overthrow by Hume. In his turn. Hume (despite his explicit repudiation in his Treatise, Part I, Sect. VI) was a thorough conservative, and in his explanation of mentality and its content never moved away from the subject-predicate habits of thought [81] which had been impressed on the European mind by the overemphasis on Aristotle's logic during the long mediaeval period.

I also discard Locke\\'s term \\'idea. 7 Instead of that term, the other things, in their limited r61es as elements for the actual entity in question, are called \\'objects 7 for that thing. There are four main types of objects, namely, \\'eternal objects, 7 \\'propositions, 7 \\'objectified 7 actual entities and nexus. These \\'eternal objects 7 are Locke\\'s ideas as explained in his Essay (II, I, l),t where he writes: Idea is the object of thinking. — Every man being conscious to himself that he thinks, and that which his mind is applied about, whilst thinking, being the ideas that are there, it is past doubt that men have in their mind several ideas, such as aret those expressed by the words, \"whiteness, hardness, sweetness, thinking, motion, man, elephant, army, drunkenness, 77 and others. But latert (III, III, 2), when discussing general terms (and subconsciously, earlier in his discussion of \\'substance 7 in II, XXIII), he adds parenthetically another type of ideas which are practically what I term \\'objectified actual entities\\' and \\'nexus. 7 He calls them \\'ideas of particular things 7 ; and he explains why, in general, such ideas cannot have their separate names. The reason is simple and undeniable: there are too many actual entities. He writes: \"But it is beyond the power of human capacity to frame and retain distinct ideas of all the particular things we meet with: every bird and beast men saw, [83] every tree and plant that affected the senses, could not find a place in the most capacious understanding. 77 The context shows that it is not the impossibility of an \\'idea 7 of any particular thing which is the seat of the difficulty; it is solely their number. This notion of a direct \\'idea\\' (or \\'feeling\\') of an actual entity is a presupposition of all common sense; Santayana ascribes it to \\'animal faith. 7 But it accords very ill with the sensationalist theory of knowledge which can be derived',\n",

       " ' The principle that I am adopting is that consciousness presupposes experience, and not experience consciousness. It is a special element in the subjective forms of some feelings. Thus an actual entity may, or may not, be conscious of some part of its experience. Its experience is its complete formal constitution, including its consciousness, if any. Thus, in Locke\\'s phraseology, its \\'ideas of particular things\\' are those other things exercising their function as felt components of its constitution. Locke would only term them \\'ideas\\' when these objectifications belong to that region of experience lit up by consciousness. In Section 4t of the same chapter, he definitely makes all knowledge to be \"founded in particular things. 77 He writes: \". . . yet a distinct name for every particular thing would not be of any great use for the improvement of knowledge: which, though founded in particular things, 1 * enlarges itself by general views; to which things reduced into sortst under general names, are properly subservient/ 7 Thus for Locke, in this passage, there are not first the qualities and then the conjectural particular things; but conversely. Also he illustrates his meaning of a \\'particular thing\\' by a leaf/ a \\'crow, 7 a \\'sheep, 7 a \\'grain of sand. 7 So he is not thinking of a particular patch of colour, or other sense-datum. 17 For example, [84] in Section 7 of the same chapter, in reference to children he writes: \"The ideas of the nurse and the mother are well framed in their minds; and, like pictures of them there, represent only those individuals. 77 This doctrine of Locke\\'s must be compared with Descartes\\' doctrine of \\'realitas objectiva. 7 Locke inherited the dualistic separation of mind from body. If he had started with the one fundamental notion of an actual entity, \\'.he complex of ideas disclosed in consciousness would have at once turned into the complex constitution of the actual entity disclosed in its own consciousness, so far as it is conscious— fitfully, partially, or not at all. Locke definitely states how ideas become general. In Section 6 of the chapter he writes: \". . . and ideas become general by separating from them the circumstances of time, and place, and any other ideas that may determine them to this or that particular existence.\" Thus for Locke the abstract idea is preceded by the \\'idea of a particular existent\\'; \"[children] frame an idea which they find those many particulars do partake in. 7 \\' This statement of Locke\\'s should be compared with the Category of Conceptual Valuation, which is the fourth categoreal obligation.',\n",

Unfortunately, he presupposes both the Cartesian dualism whereby minds are one kind of particulars, and natural entities are another kind [85] of particulars, and also the subject-predicate dogma. He is thus, in company with Descartes, driven to a theory of representative perception. For example, in one of the quotations already cited,t he writes: \"and, like pictures of them there, represent only those individuals. 77 This doctrine obviously creates an insoluble problem for epistemology, only to be solved either by some sturdy make-believe of \\'animal faith, 7 with Santayana, or by some doctrine of illusorinesst— some doctrine of mere appearance, inconsistent if taken as real — with Bradley.

He writes:\",\n",
       " ' The mind, being, as I have declared, furnished with a great number of the simple ideas conveyed in by the senses, as they are found in exterior things, or by reflection on its own operations, takes notice, also, that a certain number of these simple ideas go constantly together; [86] which being presumed to belong to one thing, and words being suited to common apprehensions, and made use of for quick dispatch, are called, so united in one subject, by one name; which, by inadvertency, we are apt afterward to talk of and consider as one simple idea, which indeed is a complication of many ideas together: because,',\n",

The universals involved obtain that status by reason of the fact that \\'they are found in exterior things\\' This is Locke\\'s assertion and it is the assertion of the philosophy of organism. It can also be conceived as a development of Descartes\\' doctrine of \\'realitas objectiva. 7 The universals are the only elements in the data describable by concepts, because concepts are merely the analytic functioning of universals. But the \\'exterior things/ although they are not expressible by concepts in respect to their individual particularity, are no less data for feeling; so that the concrescent actuality arises from feeling their status of individual particularity; and thus that particularity is included as an element from which feelings originate, and which they concern.',\n",
       " ' The sentence later proceeds with, \"a certain number of these simple ideas go constantly together.\" This can only mean that in the immediate perception \\'a certain number of these simple ideas\\' are found together in an exterior thing, and that the recollection of antecedent moments of experience discloses that the same fact, of [87] togetherness in an exterior thing, holds for the same set of simple ideas. Again, the philosophy of organism agrees that this description is true for moments of immediate experience. But Locke, owing to the fact that he veils his second premise under the phrase \\'go constantly together,\\' omits to consider the question whether the \\'exterior things\\' of the successive moments are to be identified.',\n",
       " \" The answer of the philosophy of organism is that, in the sense in which Locke is here speaking, the exterior things of successive moments are not to be identified with each other. Each exterior thing is either one actual entity, or (more frequently) is a nexus of actual entities with immediacies mutually contemporary. For the sake of simplicity we will speak only of the simpler case where the 'exterior thing' means one actual entity at the moment in question. But what Locke is explicitly concerned with is the notion of the self-identity of the one enduring physical body which lasts for years, or for seconds, or for ages. He is considering the current philosophical notion of an individualized particular substance (in the Aristotelian sense) which undergoes adventures of change, retaining its substantial form amid transition oft accidents. Throughout his Essay, he in effect retains this notion while rightly insisting on its vagueness and obscurity. The philosophy of organism agrees with Locke and Hume, that the non-in-\",\n",

The individualized substance (of Locke) must be construed to be the historic route constituted by some society of fundamental 'exterior things,' stretching from the first 'thing' to the last 'thing/\",\n",
       " \" [88] But Locke, throughout his Essay, rightly insists that the chief ingredient in the notion of 'substance' is the notion of 'power/ The philosophy of organism holds that,t in order to understand 'power/ we must have a correct notion of how each individual actual entity contributes to the datum from which its successors arise and to which they must conform. The reason why the doctrine of power is peculiarly relevant to the enduring things, which the philosophy of Locke's day conceived as individualized substances, is that any likeness between the successive occasions of at historic route procures a corresponding identity between their contributions to the datum of any subsequent actual entity; and it therefore secures a corresponding intensification in the imposition of conformity. The principle is the same as that which holds for the more sporadic occasions in empty space; but the uniformity along the historic route increases the degree of conformity which that route exacts from the future. In particular each historic route of like occasions tends to prolong itself, by reason of the weight of uniform inheritance derivable from its members. The philosophy of organism abolishes the detached mind. Mental activity is one of the modes of feeling belonging to all actual entities in some degree, but only amounting to conscious intellectuality in some actual entities. This higher grade of mental activity is the intellectual self analysis of the entity in an earlier stage of incompletion, effected by intellectual feelings produced in a later stage of concrescence. 18\",\n",

This is the problem of the solidarity of the universe. The classical doctrines of universals and particulars, of subject and predicate, of individual substances not present in other individual substances, of [89] the externality of relations, alike render this problem incapable of solution. The answer given by the organic philosophy is the doctrine of prehensions, involved in concrescent integrations, and terminating in a definite, complex unity of feeling. To be actual must mean that all actual things are alike objects, enjoying objective immortality in fashioning creative actions; and that all actual things are subjects, each prehending the universe from which',\n",

One of them under the influence of the main doctrines of the school should survey experience with some adequacy, but inconsistently.

       " \" [91] In this important passage, Locke enunciates the main doctrines of the philosophy of organism, namely: the principle of relativity; the relational character of eternal objects, whereby they constitute the forms of the objectifications of actual entities for each other; the composite character of an actual entity (i.e., a substance); the notion of 'power' as making a principal ingredient in that of actual entity (substance). In this latter notion, Locke adumbrates both the ontological principle, and also the principle that the 'power' of one actual entity on the other is simply how the former is objectified in the constitution of the other. Thus the problem of perception and the problem of power are one and the same, at least so far as perception is reduced to mere prehension of actual entities. Perception, in the sense of consciousness of such prehension, requires the additional factor of the conceptual prehension of eternal objects, and a process of integration of the two factors (cf. Part III).\",\n",
       " \" Locke's doctrine of 'power' is reproduced in the philosophy of organism by the doctrine of the two types of objectification, namely, (a) 'causal objectification,' and (p) 'presentational objectification.'\",\n",
       " \" In 'causal objectification' what is felt subjectively by the objectified actual entity is transmitted objectively to the concrescent actualities which supersede it. In Locke's phraseology the objectified actual entity is then exerting 'power.' In this type of objectification the eternal objects, relational between object and subject, express the formal constitution of the objectified actual entity.\",\n",
       " \" In 'presentational objectification' the relational eternal objects fall into two sets, one set contributed by the 'extensive' perspective of the perceived from the position of the perceiver, and the other set by the antecedent concrescent phases of the perceiver. What is ordinarily termed 'perception' is consciousness of presentational objectification. But according to the philosophy of organism there can be consciousness of both types of objectification. There can be such consciousness of both [92] types because, according to this philosophy, the knowable is the complete nature of the knower, at least such phases of it as are antecedent to that operation of knowing.\",\n",

Every actual entity is what it is, and is with its definite status in the universe, determined by its internal relations to other actual entities. 'Change' is the description of the adventures of eternal objects in the evolving universe of actual things.\",\n",
       " ' The doctrine of internal relations introduces another consideration which cannot be overlooked without error. Locke considers the \\'real essence\\' and the \\'nominal essence\\' of things. But on the theory of the general relativity of actual things between each other, and of the internality of these relations, there are two distinct notions hidden under the term \\'real essence/ both of importance. Locke writes (III, III, 15) : Essence may be taken for the being of any thing, whereby it is what it is. And thus the real internal (but generally in substances unknown) constitution of things, whereon their discoverable qualities depend, may be called their \"essence/ 7 ... It is true, there is ordinarily supposed a real constitution of the sorts of things: and it is past doubt there must be some real constitution, on which any collection of simple ideas co-existing must depend. But it being evident that things are ranked under names into sorts or species only as they agree to certain abstract ideas to which we have annexed those t names, the essence of each genus or sort comes to be nothing but that abstract idea, which the general or \"sortal\" (if I may have leave so to call it from \"sort,\" as I do \"general\" from genus) name stands for. And thist we shall find to be that which the word \"essence\" imparts in its mostt familiar use. These two sorts of essences, I suppose, may not unfitly be termed, the one the \"real,\" the other the \"nominal,\" essence.',\n",
       " ' [93] The fundamental notion of the philosophy of organism is expressed in Locke\\'s phrase, \"it is past doubt there must be some real constitution, on which any collection of simple ideas co-existing must depend.\" Locke makes it plain (cf. II, II, 1) that by a \\'simple idea\\' he means the ingression in the actual entity (illustrated by \\'a piece of wax/ \\'a piece of ice/ \\'a rose\\') of some abstract quality which is not complex (illustrated by \\'softness/ \\'warmth/ \\'whiteness\\') . For Locke such simple ideas, coexisting^ in an actual entity, require a real constitution for that entity. Now in the philosophy of organism, passing beyond Locke\\'s explicit statement, the notion of a real constitution is taken to mean that the eternal objects function by introducing the multiplicity of actual entities as constitutive of the actual entity in question. Thus the constitution is \\'real\\' because it assigns its status in the real world to the actual entity. In other words the actual entity, in virtue of being what it is, is also where it is. It is somewhere because it is some actual thing with its correlated actual world. This is the direct denial of the Cartesian doctrine, \". . . an existent thing which requires nothing but itself in order to exist.\" It is also inconsistent with Aristotle\\'s phrase, \"neither asserted of a subject nor present in a subject.\" I am certainly not maintaining that Locke grasped explicitly the impli-',\n",
       " '  60 Discussions and Applications',\n",
       " \" cations of his words as thus developed for the philosophy of organism. But it is a short step from a careless phrase to a flash of insight; nor is it unbelievable that Locke saw further into metaphysical problems than some of his followers. But abandoning the question of what Locke had in his own mind, the 'organic doctrine' demands a 'real essence 7 in the sense of a complete analysis of the relations, and inter-relations of the actual entities which are formative of the actual entity in question, and an 'abstract essence' in which the specified actual entities are replaced by the notions of unspecified entities in such a combination: this is the notion of an unspecified actual entity. Thus the real [94] essence involves real objectifications of specified actual entities; the abstract essence is a complex eternal object. There is nothing self-contradictory in the thought of many actual entities with the same abstract essence; but there can only be one actual entity with the same real essence. For the real essence indicates 'where' the entity is, that is to say, its status in the real world; the abstract essence omits the particularity of the status.\",\n",
       " ' The philosophy of organism in its appeal to the facts can thus support itself by an appeal to the insight of John Locke, who in British philosophy is the analogue to Plato, in the epoch of his life, in personal endowments, in width of experience, and in dispassionate statement of conflicting intuitions.',\n",
       " \" This doctrine of organism is the attempt to describe the world as a process of generation of individual actual entities, each with its own absolute self-attainment. This concrete finality of the individual is nothing else than a decision referent beyond itself. The 'perpetual perishing' (cf. Locke, II, XIV, It) of individual absoluteness is thus foredoomed. But the 'perishing' of absoluteness is the attainment of 'objective immortality.' This last conception expresses the further element in the doctrine of organism—that the process of generation is to be described in terms of actual entities.\",\n",

The contemporary world is in fact divided and atomic, being a multiplicity of definite actual entities. These contemporary actual entities are divided from each other, and are not themselves divisible into other contemporary actual entities. This antithesis will have to be discussed later (cf. Part IV). But it is necessary to adumbrate it here.',\n",
       " \" This limitation of the way in which the contemporary actual entities are relevant to the 'formal' existence of the subject in question is the first example of the general [97] principle, that objectification relegates into irrelevance, or into a subordinate relevance, the full constitution of the objectified entity. Some real component in the objectified entity assumes the r61e of being how that particular entity is a datum in the experience of the subject. In this case, the objectified contemporaries are only directly relevant to the subject in their character of arising from a datum which is an extensive continuum. They do, in fact, atomize this continuum; but the aboriginal potentiality, which they include and realize, is what they contribute as the relevant factor in their objectifications. They thus exhibit the community of contemporary actualities as a common world with mathematical relations— where the term 'mathematical' is used in the sense in which it would have been understood by Plato, Euclid, and Descartes, before the modern discovery of the true definition of pure mathematics.\",\n",
       " \" The bare mathematical potentialities of the extensive continuum require an additional content in order to assume the role of real objects for the subject.

Their givenness does not arise from the 'decision' of the contemporary entities which are thus objectified. It arises from the functioning of the antecedent physical body of the subject; and this functioning can in its turn be analysed as representing the influence of the more remote past, a past common alike to the subject and to its contemporary actual entities. Thus these sense-data are eternal objects playing a complex relational role; they connect the actual entities of the past with the actual entities of the contemporary world, and thereby effect objectifications of the contemporary things and of the past things. For instance, we see the contemporary chair, but we see it with our eyes; and we touch the contemporary chair, but we touch it with our hands.

But the eyes and the hands are in the past (the almost immediate past) and the chair is in the present The chair, thus objectified, is the objectification of a contemporary nexus of actual entities in its unity as one nexus. This nexus is illustrated as to its constitution by the spatial region, with its perspective relations. This region is, in fact, atomized by the members of the nexus. By the operation of the Category of Transmutation (cf. Parts III and IV), in the objectification an abstraction is made from the multiplicity of members and from all components of their formal constitutions, except the occupation of this region. This prehension, in the particular example considered, will be termed the prehension of a 'chairimage/ Also the intervention of the past is not confined to antecedent eyes and hands. There is a more remote past throughout nature external to the body. The direct relevance of this remote past, relevant by reason of its direct objectification in the immediate subject, is practically negligible, so far as concerns prehensions of a strictly physical type.\",\n",

In this way there are in it various historical routes of intermediate objectifications.

But this external environment which is in the past of the concrescent subject is also, with negligible exceptions, in the past of the nexus which is the objectified chair-image. If there be a 'real chair/ there will be another historical route of objectifications from nexus to nexus in this environment. The members of each nexus will be mutually contemporaries. Also the historical route will lead up to the nexus which is the chair-image. The complete nexus, composed of this historical route and the [99] chair-image, will form a 'corpuscular' society. This society is the 'real chair/\",\n",

The word \\'delusive\\'\" is all very well as a technical term; but it must not be misconstrued to mean that what we have directly perceived, we have not directly perceived. Our direct perception, via our senses, of an immediate extensive shape, in a certain geometrical perspective to ourselves, and in certain general geometrical relations to the contemporary world, remains an ultimate fact. Our inferences are at fault. In Cartesian phraseology, it is a final \\'inspectio\\' (also termed Hntuitio\\') which, when purged of all \\'judicium— i.e., of \\'inference — is final for belief. This whole question of \\'delusive\\' perception must be considered later (cf. Part III, Chs. Ill to V) in more [100] detail. We can, however, see at once that there are grades of \\'delusiveness.\\' There is the non-delusive case, when we see a chair-image and there is a chair. There is the partially delusive case when we have been looking in a mirror; in this case, the chair-image we see is not the culmination of the corpuscular society of entities which we call the real chair. Finally, we may have been taking drugs, so that the chair-image we see has no familiar counterpart in any historical route of a corpuscular society. Also there are other delusive grades where the lapse of time is the main element. These cases are illustrated by our perceptions of the heavenly bodies. In delusive cases we are apt, in a confusing way, to say that the societies of entities which we did not see but correctly inferred are the things that we \\'really\\' saw.',\n",
       " \" The conclusion of this discussion is that the ingression of the eternal objects termed 'sense-data' t into the experience of a subject cannot be construed as the simple objectification of the actual entity to which, inordinary speech, we ascribe that sense-datum as a quality. The ingression involves a complex relationship, whereby the sense-datum emerges as the 'given' eternal object by which some past entities are objectified (for example, colour seen with the eyes and bad temper inherited from the viscera) and whereby the sense-datum also enters into the objectification of a society of actual entities in the contemporary world. Thus a sensedatum has ingression into experience by reason of its forming the what of a very complex multiple integration of prehensions within that occasion. For example, the ingression of a visual sense-datum involves the causal objectification of various antecedent bodily organs and the presentational objectification of the shape seen, this shape being a nexus of contemporary actual entities. In this account of the ingression of sense-data, the animal body is nothing more than the most intimately relevant part of the antecedent settled world.

Later (cf. Part III, Chs. Ill to V) the whole question of this perception of a nexus vaguely, that is to say, without distinction of the actual entities composing it, is discussed in terms of the theory of prehensions, and in relation to the Category of Transmutation.\",\n",

       " \" This account of 'presentational immediacy' presupposes two metaphysical assumptions:\",\n",
       " \" (i) That the actual world, in so far as it is a community of entities which are settled, actual, and already become, conditions and limits the potentiality for creativeness beyond itself. This 'given' world provides determinate data in the form of those objectifications of themselves which the characters of its actual entities can provide. This is a limitation laid upon the general potentiality provided by eternal objects, considered merely in respect to the generality of their natures. Thus, relatively to any actual entity, there is a 'giver/ world of settled actual entities and a 'real' potentiality, which is the datum for creativeness beyond that standpoint. This datum, which is the primary phase in the process constituting an actual entity, is nothing else than the actual world itself in its character of a possibility for the process of being felt. This exemplifies the metaphysical principle that every 'being' is a potential for a 'becoming/ The actual world is the 'objective content' of each new creation.\",\n",
       " \" Thus we have always to consider two meanings of [102] potentiality: (a) the 'general' potentiality, which is the bundle of possibilities, mutually consistent or alternative, provided by the multiplicity of eternal objects, and (b) the 'real' potentiality, which is conditioned by the data provided by the actual world. General potentiality is absolute, and real potentiality is relative to some actual entity, taken as a standpoint whereby the actual world is denned. It must be remembered that the phrase 'actual world' is like 'yesterday' and 'tomorrow/ in that it alters its meaning according to standpoint. The actual world must always mean the community of all actual entities, including the primordial actual entity called 'God' and the temporal actual entities.\",\n",
       " \" Curiously enough, even at this early stage of metaphysical discussion, the influence of the 'relativity theory' of modern physics is important. According to the classical 'uniquely serial' view of time, two contemporary actual entities define the same actual world. According to the modern view\",\n",
       " '  66 Discussions and Applications',\n",
       " \" no two actual entities define the same actual world. Actual entities are called 'contemporary' when neither belongs to the given* actual world defined by the other.\",\n",
       " \" The differences between the actual worlds of a pair of contemporary entities, which are in a certain sense 'neighbours/ are negligible for most human purposes. Thus the difference between the 'classical' and the 'relativity' view of time only rarely has any important relevance. I shall always adopt the relativity view; for one reason, because it seems better to accord with the general philosophical doctrine of relativity which is presupposed in the philosophy of organism; and for another reason, because with rare exceptions the classical doctrine can be looked on as a special case of the relativity doctrine— a case which does not seem to accord with experimental evidence. In other words, the classical view seems to limit a general philosophical doctrine; it is the larger assumption; and its consequences, taken in conjunction with other scientific principles, seem to be false.\",\n",
       " \" [J 03] (ii) The second metaphysical assumption is that the real potentialities relative to all standpoints are coordinated as diverse determinations of one extensive continuum. This extensive continuum is one relational complex in which all potential objectifications find their niche. It underlies the whole world, past, present, and future. Considered in its full generality, apart from the additional conditions proper only to the cosmic epoch of electrons, protons, molecules, and star-systems, the properties of this continuum are very few and do not include the relationships of metrical geometry. An extensive continuum is a complex of entities united by the various allied relationships of whole to part, and of overlapping so as to possess common parts, and of contact, and of other relationships derived from these primary relationships. The notion of a 'continuum' involves both the property of indefinite divisibility and the property of unbounded extension. There are always entities beyond entities, because nonentity is no boundary. This extensive continuum expresses the solidarity of all possible standpoints throughout the whole process of the world. It is not a fact prior to the world; it is the first determination of order— that is, of real potentiality— arising out of the general character of the world. In its full generality beyond the present epoch, it does not involve shapes, dimensions, or measurability; these are additional determinations of real potentiality arising from our cosmic epoch.\",\n",

The objectification of the contemporary world merely expresses that world in terms of its potentiality for subdivision and in terms of the mutual perspectives which any such subdivision will bring into real effectiveness. These are the primary governing data for any actual entity; for they express how all actual entities are in the solidarity of one world. With the becoming of any actual entity what was previously potential in the space-time continuum is now the primary real phase in something actual. For each process of concrescence a regional standpoint in the world, defining a limited potentiality for objectifications, has been adopted. In the mere extensive continuum there is no principle to determine what regional quanta shall be atomized, so as to form the real perspective standpoint for the primary data constituting the basic phase in the concrescence of an actual entity. The factors in the actual world whereby this determination is effected will be discussed at a later stage of this investigation. They constitute the initial phase of the 'subjective aim/ This initial phase is a direct derivate from God's primordial nature. In this function, as in every other, God is the organ of novelty, aiming at intensification.\",\n",

Every actual entity in its relationship to other actual entities is in this sense somewhere in the continuum, and arises out of the data provided by this standpoint. But in another sense it is everywhere throughout the continuum; for its constitution includes the objectifications of the actual world and thereby includes the continuum; also the [105] potential objectifications of itself contribute to the real potentialities whose solidarity the continuum expresses. Thus the continuum is present in each actual entity, and each actual entity pervades the continuum.',\n",

Extension, apart from its spatialization and temporalization, is that general scheme of relationships providing the capacity that many objects can be welded into the real unity of one experience. Thus, an act of experience has an objective scheme of extensive order by reason of the double fact that its own perspective standpoint has extensive content, and that the other actual entities are objectified with the retention of their extensive relationships. These extensive relationships are more fundamental than their more special spatial and temporal relationships. Extension is the most general scheme of real potentiality, providing the background for all other organic relations. The potential scheme does not determine its own atomization by actual entities.

These conclusions are required by the consideration 3 of Zeno\\'s arguments, in connection with the presumption that an actual entity is an act of experience. The authority of William James can be quoted in support of this conclusion. He writes: \"Either your experience is of no content, of no change, or it is of a perceptible amount of content or change. Your acquaintance with reality grows literally by buds or drops of perception. Intellectually and on reflection you can divide these into components, but as immediately given, [106] they come totally or not at all.\" 4 James also refers to Zeno. In substance I agree with his argument from Zeno; though I do not think that he allows sufficiently for those elements in Zeno\\'s paradoxes which are the product of inadequate mathematical knowledge. But I agree that a valid argument remains after the removal of the invalid parts.',\n",
       " ' The argument, so far as it is valid, elicits a contradiction from the two premises: (i) that in a becoming something (res vera) becomes, and (ii) that every act of becoming is divisible into earlier and later sections which are themselves acts of becoming. Consider, for example, an act of becoming during one second. The act is divisible into two acts, one during the earlier half of the second, the other during the later half of the second. Thus that which becomes during the whole second presupposes that which becomes during the first half-second. Analogously, that which becomes during the first half-second presupposes that which becomes during the first quarter-second, and so on indefinitely. Thus if we consider the process of becoming up to the beginning of the second in question, and ask what then becomes, no answer can be given. For, whatever creature we indicate presupposes an earlier creature which became after the beginning of the second and antecedently to the indicated t creature. Therefore there is nothing which becomes, so as to effect a transition into the second in question.',\n",

Eliminating the irrelevant details of the race and of motion— details which have endeared the paradox to the literature of all ages— consider the first half-second as one act of becoming, the next quarter-second as another such act, the next eighth-second as yet another, and so on indefinitely. Zeno then illegitimately assumes this infinite series of acts of becoming can never be exhausted. But there is no need to assume that an infinite series of acts of becoming, with a first act, and each act with an immediate successor,! is inexhaustible in the process of becoming. Simple arithmetic assures us that the series just indicated will be exhausted in the period of one second. The way is then open for the intervention of a new act of becoming which lies beyond the whole series. Thus this paradox of Zeno is based upon a mathematical fallacy.\",\n",

The concrescence is dominated by a subjective aim which essentially concerns the creature as a final superject. This subjective aim is this subject itself determining its own self-creation as one creature. Thus the subjective aim does not share in this divisibility. If we confine attention to prehensions concerned with the earlier half, their subjective forms have arisen from nothing. For the subjective aim which belongs to the whole is now excluded.

The alternative doctrine, which is the Newtonian cosmology, emphasized the [109] 'receptacle' theory of space-time, and minimized the factor of potentiality. Thus bits of space and time were conceived as being as actual as anything else, and as being 'occupied' by other actualities which were the bits of matter.

It is from their essence or nature that they are places; and that the primary places of things should be movable, is absurd. These are, therefore, the absolute places; and translations out of those places are the only absolute motions. . . .

True motion is neither generated nor altered, but by some force impressed upon the body moved: but relative motion may be generated or altered without any force impressed upon the body. For it is sufficient only to impress some force on other bodies with which the former is compared, that by their giving way, that relation may be changed, in which the relative rest or motion of this other body did consist. . . . The effects which distinguish absolute from relative motion are, the forces of receding from the axis of circular motion.

He was then left with the antithesis between \\'sensible objects\\' and empty space. Newton, indeed, as a private opinion, conjectured that there is a material medium pervading space. But he also held that there might not be such a medium. For him the notion \\'empty space\\'— that is, mere spatiality — had sense, conceived as an independent actual existence \\'from infinity to infinity/ In this he differed from Descartes. Modern physics sides with Descartes. It has introduced the notion of the \\'physical field.\\' Also the latest speculations tend to remove the sharp distinction between the \\'occupied\\' portions of the field and the \\'unoccupied\\' portion. Further, in these lectures (cf. Ch. Ill of Part II), a distinction is introduced, not explicitly in the mind either of \\'the vulgar\\' or of Newton. This distinction is that between (i) an actual entity, (ii) an enduring object, (hi) a corpuscular society, (iv) a noncorpuscular society, (v) a non-social nexus. A non-social nexus is what answers to the notion of \\'chaos.\\' The extensive continuum is that general relational element in experience whereby the actual entities experienced, and that unit experience itself, are united in the solidarity of one common world. The actual entities atomize it, and thereby make real what was antecedently merely potential. The atomization of the extensive continuum is also its temporalization; that is to say, it is the process of the becoming of actuality into what in itself is merely potential. The systematic scheme, in its completeness embracing the actual past and the potential future, is prehended in the positive experience of each actual entity. In this sense, it is Kant\\'s \\'form of intuition\\'; but it is derived from the actual world qua datum, and thus is not \\'pure\\' in Kant\\'s sense of that term. It is not productive of the ordered world, but derivative from it.

At the same time we must at least confess that the things which are represented to us in sleep are like painted representations which can only have been formed as the counterparts of something real and true [ad similiiudinem rerum verarum], and that in this way those general things at least, i.e. eyes, a head, hands, and a whole body, are not imaginary things, but things really existent. . . . And for the same reason, although these general things, to wit, [a body], 6 eyes, a head, hands, and such like, may be imaginary, we are bound at the same time to confess that there are at least some other objects yet more simple and more universal, which are real and true [vera esse]; and of these just in the same way as with certain real colours, all these images of things which dwell in our thoughts, whether true and real or false and fantastic, are formed.',\n",

Such statements witness to direct knowledge of the antecedent functioning of the body in sense-perception. Both agreethough Hume more explicitly— that sense-perception of the contemporary world is accompanied by perception of the \\'withness\\' of the body. It is this withness that makes the body the starting point for our knowledge of the circumambient world. We find here our direct knowledge of \\'causal efficacy/ Hume and Descartes in their theory of direct perceptive knowledge dropped out this withness of the body; and thus confined perception to presentational immediacy. Santayana, in his doctrine of \\'animal faith/ practically agrees with Hume and Descartes as to this withness of the actual world, including the body.

The later, sophisticated perception is 'feeling the contemporary world/ Even this presentational immediacy begins with [126] sense-presentation of the contemporary body. The body, however, is only a peculiarly intimate bit of the world.

These chapters are concerned with the allied problems of 'order in the universe/ of 'induction/ and of 'general truths/ The present chapter is wholly concerned with the topic of 'order/ For the organic doctrine the problem of order assumes primary importance. No actual entity can rise beyond what the actual world as a datum from its standpoint— its actual world— allows it to be. Each such entity arises from a primary phase of the concrescence of objectifications which are in some respects settled: the basis of its experience is 'given/ Now the correlative of 'order' is 'disorder/ There can be no peculiar meaning in the notion of 'order' unless this contrast holds. Apart from it, 'order* must be a synonym for 'givenness/ But 'order' means more than 'givenness/ though it presupposes 'givenness';t 'disorder' is also 'given/ Each actual entity requires a totality of 'givenness/ and each totality of 'givenness' attains its measure of 'order/\",\n",

Thus every definite total phase of 'givenness' involves a reference to that specific 'order' which is its dominant ideal, and involves the specific 'disorder' due to its inclusion of 'given' components which exclude the attainment of the full ideal.

       " \" and thus there is some 'order/ There is not just one ideal 'order' which all actual entities should attain and fail to attain . In each case there is an ideal peculiar to each particular actual entity, and arising from the dominant components in its phase of 'givenness.' This notion of 'dominance* will have to be discussed later in connection with the notion of the systematic character of a 'cosmic epoch' and of the subordinate systematic characters of 'societies' included in a cosmic epoch. The notion of one ideal arises from the disastrous overmoralization of thought under the influence of fanaticism, or pedantry. The notion of a dominant ideal peculiar to each actual entity is Platonic.\",\n",
       " \" It is notable that no biological science has been able to express itself apart from phraseology which is meaningless unless it refers to ideals proper to the organism in question. This aspect of the universe impressed itself on that great biologist and philosopher, Aristotle. His philosophy led to a wild overstressing of the notion of 'final causes'! during the Christian middle ages; and thence, by a reaction, to the correlative overstressing of [129] the notion of 'efficient causes' during the modern scientific period. One task of a sound metaphysics is to exhibit final and efficient causes in their proper relation to each other. The necessity and the difficulty of this task are stressed by Hume in his Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion.\",\n",
       " \" Thus the notion of 'order' is bound up with the notion of an actual entity as involving an attainment which is a specific satisfaction. This satisfaction is the attainment of something individual to the entity in question. It cannot be construed as a component contributing to its own concrescence; it is the ultimate fact, individual to the entity. The notion of 'satisfaction' is the notion of the 'entity as concrete' abstracted from the 'process of concrescence'; it is the outcome separated from the process, thereby losing the actuality of the atomic entity, which is both process and outcome. 'Satisfaction' provides the individual element in the composition of the actual entity— that element which has led to the definition of substance as 'requiring nothing but itself in order to exist.' But the 'satisfaction' is the 'superject' rather than the 'substance' or the 'subject.' It closes up the entity; and yet is the superject adding its character to the creativity whereby there is a becoming of entities superseding the one in question. The 'formal' reality of the actuality in question belongs to its process of concrescence and not to its 'satisfaction/ This is the sense in which the philosophy of organism interprets Plato's phrase 'and never really is'; for the superject can only be interpreted in terms of its 'objective immortality/\",\n",

These specific differences can only be expressed by the analysis of the components in the concrescence out of which the actual entity arises.

The process of concrescence terminates with the attainment of a fully determinate 'satisfaction'; and the creativity thereby passes over into the 'given' primary phase for the concrescence of other actual entities. This transcendence is thereby established when there is attainment of determinate 'satisfaction' completing the antecedent entity. Completion is the perishing of immediacy: 'It never really is/f\",\n",
       " \" No actual entity can be conscious of its own satisfaction; for such knowledge would be a component in the process, and would thereby alter the satisfaction. In respect to the entity in question the satisfaction can only be considered as a creative determination, by which the objectifications of the entity beyond itself are settled. In other words, the 'satisfaction' of an entity can only be discussed in terms of the usefulness of that entity. It is a qualification of creativity. The tone of feeling embodied in this satisfaction passes into the world beyond, by reason of these objectifications. The world is self-creative; and the actual entity as self-creating creature passes into its immortal function of part-creator of the transcendent world. In its self-creation the actual entity is guided by its ideal of itself as individual satisfaction and as transcendent creator. The enjoyment of this ideal is the 'subjective aim/ by reason of which the actual entity is a determinate process.\",\n",

These subjective ways of feeling are not merely receptive of the data as alien facts; they clothe the dry bones with the flesh of a real being, emotional, purposive, appreciative.

This is the ingression of an eternal object in the r61e of a conceptual lure for feeling. The second phase is the admission of the lure into the reality of feeling, or its rejection from this reality. The relevance of an eternal object in its role of lure is a fact inherent in the data.

       " ' An example of the lure for feeling is given by Hume himself. In the first section of his Treatise* he lays down the proposition, \"That all our simple ideas in their first appearance, are derived from simple impressions ? which are correspondent to them, and which they exactly represent!\\' It must be remembered that in the organic philosophy the \\'data of objectifications\\' are the nearest analogue to Hume\\'s \\'simple impressions/ Thus, modifying Hume\\'s principle, the only lure to conceptual feeling is an exact conformation to the qualities realized in the objectified actualities. But Hume (toe. eft.) notes an exception which carries with it the exact principle which has just been laid down, namely, the principle of relevant potentials, unrealized in the datum and yet constituent of an \\'objective lure\\' by proximity to the datum. The point is that \\'order\\' in the actual world introduces a derivative \\'order\\' among eternal objects. Hume writes: There is. however, one contradictory phenomenon, which may prove, that it is not absolutely impossible for ideas to go before their correspondent impressions. I believe it will readily be allowed, that the several distinct ideas of colours, which enter by the eyes, orf those of sounds, which are conveyed by the hearing, are really different from each other, though, at the same time, resembling. Now, if this be true of different colours, it must be no less so of the different shades of the same colour, that each of them produces a distinct idea, independent of the rest. . . . Suppose, therefore, a person to have enjoyed his sight for thirty years, and to have become perfectly well acquainted with colours of all kinds, excepting one particular shade of blue, for instance, which it never hast been his fortune to meet with. Let all the different shades of that colour, except that single one, be placed before him, descending gradually from the deepest to the [133] lightest; it is plain, that he will perceive a blank, where that shade is wanting, and will be sensible that there is a greater distance in that place, betwixtt the contiguous colours, than in any other. Now I ask, whether it is possible for him, from his own imagination, to supply this deficiency, andt raise up to himself the idea of that particular shade, though it had never been',\n",

       " \" This passage requires no comment, except for its final clause. Hume puts the 'instance' aside as being 'particular and singular'; it is exactly this estimate which is challenged by the philosophy of organism. The analysis of concrescence, here adopted, conceives that there is an origination of conceptual feeling, admitting or rejecting whatever is apt for feeling by reason of its germaneness to the basic data. The gradation of eternal objects in respect to this germaneness is the 'objective lure' for feeling; the concrescent process admits a selection from this 'objective lure 7 into subjective efficiency. This is the subjective 'ideal of itself which guides the process. Also the basic data are constituted by the actual world which 'belongs to' that instance of concrescent process. Feelings are 'vectors'; for they feel what is there and transform it into what is here.\",\n",
       " \" The term 'potential difference' is an old one in physical science; and recently it has been introduced in physiology with a meaning diverse from, though generically allied to, its older meaning in physics. The ultimate fact in the constitution of an actual entity which suggests this term is the objective lure for feeling. In the comparison of two actual entities, the contrast be- \\\\134] tween their objective lures is their 'potential difference'; and all other uses of this phrase are abstractions derivative from this ultimate meaning.\",\n",
       " \" The 'objectifications' of the actual entities in the actual world, relative to a definite actual entity, constitute the efficient causes out of which that actual entity arises; the 'subjective aim' at 'satisfaction' constitutes the final cause, or lure, whereby there is determinate concrescence; and that attained 'satisfaction' remains as an element in the content of creative purpose. There is, in this way, transcendence of the creativity; and this transcendence effects determinate objectifications for the renewal of the process in the concrescence of actualities beyond that satisfied superject.\",\n",

'Order' and 'novelty' are but the instruments of his subjective aim which is the intensification of 'formal immediacy.' It is to be noted that every actual entity, including God, is something individual for its own sake; and thereby transcends the rest of actuality. And also it is to be noted that every actual entity, including God, is a creature transcended by the creativity which it qualifies. A temporal occasion in respect to the second element of its character, and God in respect to the first element of his character satisfy Spinoza's definition of substance, that it is causa sui. To be causa sui means that the process of concrescence is its own reason for the decision in respect to the qualitative clothing of feelings. It is finally responsible for the decision by which any lure for feeling is admitted to efficiency. The freedom inherent in the universe is constituted by this element of self-causation.\",\n",

The Critique of Pure Reason describes the process by which subjective data pass into the appearance of an objective world.

For Kant, the world emerges from the subject; for the philosophy of [J 36] organism, the subject emerges from the world— a 'super ject' rather than a 'subject.' The word 'object' thus means an entity which is a potentiality for being a component in feeling; and the word 'subject' means the entity constituted by the process of feeling, and including this process. The feeler is the unity emergent from its own feelings; and feelings are the details of the process intermediary between this unity and its many data. The data are the potentials for feeling; that is to say, they are objects. The process is the elimination of indeterminateness of feeling from the unity of one subjective experience.

It has been necessary to give a sketch of some categories applying to an actual entity in order to show how this can be the case. But there is a derivative sense of the term 'order/ which is more usually in our minds when we use that word. We speak of the 'order of nature/ meaning thereby the order reigning in that limited portion of the universe, 2 or even of the surface of the earth, which has come under our observation. We also speak of a man of orderly life, or of disorderly life. In any of these senses, the term 'order' evidently applies to the relations among themselves enjoyed by many actual entities which thereby form a society. The term 'society' will always be restricted to mean a nexus of actual entities which are 'ordered' among themselves in the sense to be explained in this section. 3 [137] The point of a 'society,' as the term is here used, is that it is self-sustaining; in other words, that it is its own reason. Thus a society is more than a set of entities to which the same class-name applies: that is to say, it involves more than a merely mathematical conception of 'order.' To constitute a society, the class-name has got to apply to each member, by reason of genetic derivation from other members of that same society. The members of the society are alike because, by reason of their common character, they impose on other members of the society the conditions which lead to that likeness.\",\n",
       " \" This likeness 4 consists in the fact that (i) a certain element of 'form' is a contributory component to the individual satisfaction of each member of the society; and that (ii) the contribution by the element to the objectification of any one member of the society for prehension by other members promotes its analogous reproduction in the satisfactions of those other members. Thus a set of entities is a society (i) in virtue of a 'defining characteristic' shared by its members, and (ii) in virtue of the presence of the defining characteristic being due to the environment provided by the society itself.\",\n",

Such knowledge is a common characteristic inherited from occasion to occasion along the historic route. This example has purposely been chosen for its reference to a somewhat trivial element of order, viz. knowledge of the Greek language; a more important character of order would have been that complex character in virtue of which a man is considered to be the same enduring person from birth to death. Also in this in- [138] stance the members of the society are arranged in a serial order by their genetic relations. Such a society is said 5 to possess 'personal order/\",\n",
       " ' Thus a society is, for each of its members, an environment with some element of order in it, persisting by reason of the genetic relations between its own members. Such an element of order is the order prevalent in the society.',\n",
       " ' But there is no society in isolation. Every society must be considered with its background of a wider environment of actual entities, which also contribute their objectifications to which the members of the society must conform. Thus the given contributions of the environment must at least be permissive of the self-sustenance of the society. Also, in proportion to its importance, this background must contribute those general characters which the more special character of the society presupposes for its members. But this means that the environment, together with the society in question, must form a larger society in respect to some more general characters than those defining the society from which we started. Thus we arrive at the principle that every society requires a social background, of which it is itself a part. In reference to any given society the world of actual entities is to be conceived as forming a background in layers of social order, the defining characteristics becoming wider and more general as we widen the background. Of course, the remote actualities of the background have their own specific characteristics of various types of social order. But such specific characteristics have become irrelevant for the society in question by reason of the inhibitions and attenuations introduced by discordance, that is to say, by disorder.',\n",
       " \" The metaphysical characteristics of an actual entity— in the proper general sense of 'metaphysics'— should be those which apply to all actual entities. It may be doubted whether such metaphysical concepts have ever [J 39] been formulated in their strict purity— even taking into account the most general principles of logic and of mathematics. We have to confine ourselves to societies sufficiently wide, and yet such that their defining characteristics cannot safely be ascribed to all actual entities which have been or may be.\",\n",

       " \" But there is not any perfect attainment of an ideal order whereby the indefinite endurance of a society is secured. A society arises from disorder, where 'disorder 7 is defined by reference to the ideal for that society; the favourable background of a larger environment either itself decays, or ceases to favour the persistence of the society after some stage of growth: the society then ceases to reproduce its members, and finally after a stage of decay passes out of existence. Thus a system of 'laws' determining reproduction in some portion of the universe gradually rises into dominance; it has its stage of endurance, and passes out of existence with the decay of the society from which it emanates.\",\n",

Here the phrase 'cosmic epoch' is used to mean that widest society of actual entities whose immediate relevance to ourselves is traceable. This epoch is characterized by electronic and protonic actual entities, and by yet more ultimate actual entities which can be dimly discerned in the quanta of energy. Maxwell's equations of the electromagnetic field hold sway by reason of the throngs of electrons and of protons. Also each electron is a society of electronic occasions, and each proton is a soci- [MO] ety of protonic occasions. These occasions are the reasons for the electromagnetic laws; but their capacity for reproduction, whereby each electron and each proton has a long life, and whereby new electrons and new protons come into being, is itself due to these same laws. But there is disorder in the sense that the laws are not perfectly obeyed, and that the reproduction is mingled with instances of failure. There is accordingly a gradual transition to new types of order, supervening upon a gradual rise into dominance on the part of the present natural laws.\",\n",

Part IV) it will be evident that all these properties are additional to the more basic fact of extensiveness; also, that even extensiveness allows of grades of specialization, arbitrarily one way or another, antecedently to the introduction of any of these additional notions. By this discovery the logical and mathematical investigations of the last two centuries are very relevant to philosophy. For the cosmological theories of Descartes, Newton, Locke, Hume, and Kant were framed in ignorance of that fact.

These latter societies are the strands of 'personal' order which enter into many societies; generally speaking, whenever we are concerned with occupied space, we are dealing with this restricted type of corpuscular societies; and whenever we are thinking of the physical field in empty space, we are dealing with societies of the wider type.

To the modern reader, the Timaeus, considered as a statement of scientific details, is in comparison with the Scholium simply foolish. But what it lacks in superficial detail, it makes up for by its philosophic depth. If it be read as an allegory, it conveys profound truth; whereas the Scholium is an immensely able statement of details which, although abstract and inadequate as a philosophy, can within certain limits be thoroughly trusted for the deduction of truths at the same level of abstraction as itself. The penalty of its philosophical deficiency is that the Scholium conveys no hint of the limits of its own application. The practical effect is that the readers, and almost certainly Newton himself, so construe its meaning as to fall into [143} what I have elsewhere 6 termed the 'fallacy of misplaced concreteness/ It is the office of metaphysics to determine the limits of the applicability of such abstract notions.\",\n",

For the Scholium, nature is merely, and completely, there, externally designed and obedient. The full sweep of the modern doctrine of evolution would have confused the Newton of the Scholium, but would have enlightened the Plato of the Timaeus. So far as Newton is concerned, we have his own word for this statement. In a letter to Bentley, he writes: \"When I wrote my treatise about our system, I had an eye upon such principles as might work with considering men for the belief of a Deity; . . .\" 7 The concept in Newton\\'s mind is that of a fully articulated system requiring a definite supernatural origin with that articulation. This is the form of the cosmological argument, now generally abandoned as invalid; because our notion of causation concerns the relations of states of things within the actual world, and can only be illegitimately extended to a transcendent derivation.

Part V), is that of an actual entity immanent in the actual world, but transcending any finite cosmic epoch — a being at once actual, eternal, immanent, and transcendent. The transcendence of',\n",

It is not possible to extract from the Scholium— construed with misplaced concreteness— either a theism, or an atheism, or an epistemology, which can survive a comparison with the facts. This is the inescapable conclusion to be inferred from Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion. Biology is also reduced to a mystery; and finally physics itself has now reached a stage of experimental knowledge inexplicable in terms of the categories of the Scholium.\",\n",

While noting this concurrence of the two great cosmological documents guiding Western thought, it cannot be too clearly understood that, within its limits of abstraction, what the Scholium says is true, and that it is expressed with the lucidity of genius. Thus any cosmological document which cannot be read as an interpretation of the Scholium is worthless. But there is another side to the Timaeus which finds no analogy in the Scholium. In general terms, this side of the Timaeus may be termed its metaphysical character, that is to say, its endeavour to connect the behaviour of things with the formal nature of things. The behaviour apart from the things is abstract, and so are the things apart from their behaviour. Newton— wisely, for his purposesmade this abstraction which the Timaeus endeavours to avoid.',\n",
       " ' In the first place, the Timaeus connects behaviour with the ultimate molecular characters of the actual entities. Plato conceives the notion of definite societies of actual molecular entities, each society with its defining characteristics. He does not conceive this assemblage of societies as causa sui. But he does conceive it as the work of subordinate deities, who are the animating principles of those departments of nature. In Greek thought, either poetic or philosophic, the separation between the cpOoiq and such deities had not that absolute character which it has for us who have inherited the Semitic Jehovah.',\n",
       " ' [J 45] Newton could have accepted a molecular theory as easily as Plato, but there is this difference between them: Newton would have been surprised at the modern quantum theory and at the dissolution of quanta into vibrations; Plato would have expected it. While we note the many things said by Plato in the Timaeus which are now foolishness, we must also give him credit for that aspect of his teaching in which he was two thousand years ahead of his time. Plato accounted for the sharp-cut differences between kinds of natural things, by assuming an approximation of the mole-',\n",

He also assumed that certain qualitative contrasts in occurrences, such as that between musical notes, depended on the participation of these occurrences in some of the simpler ratios between integral numbers. He thus obtained a reason why there should be an approximation to sharp-cut differences between kinds of molecules, and why there should be sharp-cut relations of harmony standing out amid dissonance. Thus 'contrast'— as the opposite of incompatibility—depends on a certain simplicity of circumstance; but the higher contrasts depend on the assemblage of a multiplicity of lower contrasts, this assemblage again exhibiting higher types of simplicity.\",\n",
       " \" It is well to remember that the modern quantum theory, + with its surprises in dealing with the atom, is only the latest instance of a well-marked character of nature, which in each particular instance is only explained by some ad hoc dogmatic assumption. The theory of biological evolution would not in itself lead us to expect the sharply distinguished genera and species which we find in nature. There might be an occasional bunching of individuals round certain typical forms; but there is no explanation of the almost complete absence of intermediate forms. Again Newton's Scholium gives no hint of the ninety-two possibilities for atoms, or of the limited number of ways in which atoms can be combined so as to form molecules. Physicists are now explaining these [J 46] chemical facts by means of conceptions which Plato would have welcomed.\",\n",
       " \" There is another point in which the organic philosophy only repeats Plato. In the Timaeus the origin of the present cosmic epoch is traced back to an aboriginal disorder, chaotic according to our ideals. This is the evolutionary doctrine of the philosophy of organism. Plato's notion has puzzled critics who are obsessed with the Semitic 8 theory of a wholly transcendent God creating out of nothing an accidental universe. Newton held the Semitic theory. The Scholium made no provision for the evolution of matter— very naturally, since the topic lay outside its scope. The result has been that the non-evolution of matter has been a tacit presupposition throughout modern thought. Until the last few years the sole alternatives were: either the material universe, with its present type of order, is eternal; or else it came into being, and will pass out of being, according to the fiat of Jehovah. Thus, on all sides, Plato's allegory of the evolution of a new type of order based on new types of dominant societies became a daydream, puzzling to commentators.\",\n",
